that route. Even faithful Sadek, whom I had
despatched to the bazaar to get camels at all
costs, returned with a long face after a whole
day's absence, and for the first time since he was
in my employ had to change his invariable
answer of "Sahib, have got," to a bitterly disappointing
"Sahib, no can get."</p>

<p>A delay was predicted on all hands of at least
a month or two in Kerman before I could
possibly obtain camels to cross the desert in
any direction towards the east. The tantalising
trials of arranging a caravan were not small.</p>

<p>I offered to purchase camels, but no camel
driver could be induced to accompany me.
Offers of treble pay and bakshish had no effect,
and I found myself in a serious dilemma when a
camel man appeared on the scene. His high
terms were then and there accepted, everything
that he asked for was conceded, when suddenly,
probably believing that all this was too good to
come true, he backed out of the bargain and
positively refused to go. Had I chosen to go
by the southern route, skirting the desert <i>via</i>
Bam, the difficulty would not have been so great,
but that route is very easy, and had been followed
by several Europeans at different times, and I
declined to go that way.</p>

<p>I was beginning to despair when Sadek, who
had spent another day hunting in the various
caravanserais, entered my room, and with a
broad grin on his generally stolid countenance,
proclaimed that he had found some good camels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-3" id="Pg_2-3"></a>[<a href="./images/2-3.png">3</a>]</span>
To corroborate his words a clumsy and heavy-footed
camel man, with a face which by association
had become like that of the beasts he led,
was shoved forward into the room.</p>

<p>He was a striking figure, with an ugly but
singularly honest countenance, his eyes staring
and abnormally opened, almost strained&mdash;the
eyes of a man who evidently lived during the
night and slept during the day. His mouth
stretched, with no exaggeration, from ear to ear,
and displayed a double row of powerful white
teeth. What was lacking in quantity of nose
was made up by a superabundance of malformed,
shapeless ears, which projected at the sides of
his head like two wings. When his legs were
closed&mdash;<i>pour fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>&mdash;they were still
some six inches apart, and a similar space was
noticeable between each of his arms and his
body. Unmistakably this fellow was the very
picture of clumsiness.</p>

<p>He seemed so much distracted by the various
articles of furniture in the Consul's room that
one could get no coherent answer from him, and
his apprehension gave way to positive terror
when he was addressed in flowing language by
the various high officials who were then calling
on the Consul. Their ways of persuasion by
threats and promises alarmed the camel man to
such an extent that his eyes roamed about all
over the place, palpably to find a way to effect
an escape. He was, however, so clumsy at it,
that the consul's servants and soldiers checked
him in time, and Sadek broke in with one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-4" id="Pg_2-4"></a>[<a href="./images/2-4.png">4</a>]</span>
his usual flows of words at the top of his voice,
which, however, could hardly be heard amid the
vigorous eloquence of the Persians present, who
all spoke at the same time, and at an equally
high pitch.</p>

<p>With a sinking heart I closely watched the
camel man, in whom rested my faint and last
hope of crossing the Salt Desert. He looked
so bewildered&mdash;and no wonder&mdash;almost terror-stricken,
that when he was asked about his
camels, the desert, the amount of pay required,
he sulkily mumbled that he had no camels,
knew nothing whatever about the desert, and
did not wish to receive any pay.</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you come here?"</p>

<p>"I did not come here!"</p>

<p>"But you are here."</p>

<p>"I want to go away."</p>

<p>"Yes, sahib," cried the chorus of Persians,
"he has the camels, he knows the desert; only
he is frightened, as he has never spoken to a
sahib before."</p>

<p>Here a young Hindoo merchant, Mul Chan
Dilaram, entered the room, and with obsequious
salaams to the company, assured me that he had
brought this camel man to me, and that when he
had got over his first fears I should find him an
excellent man. While we were all listening to the
Hindoo's assurances the camel man made a bolt
for the door, and escaped as fast as he could lay
his legs to the ground towards the city.</p>

<p>He was chased by the soldiers, and after some
time was dragged back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-5" id="Pg_2-5"></a>[<a href="./images/2-5.png">5</a>]</span></p>

<p>"Why did you run away?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"Sahib," he replied, almost crying, "I am
only a man of the desert; my only friends are
my camels; please have pity on me!"</p>

<p>"Then you have camels, and you do know
the desert; you have said so in your own
words."</p>

<p>The camel man had to agree, and on being
assured that he would be very well paid and
treated, and have a new pair of shoes given him,
and as much tea brewed for him on the road,
with as much sugar in it as his capacity would
endure, he at last said he would come. The
Hindoo, with great cunning, at once seized the
hand of the camel man in his own and made
him swear that death should descend upon himself,
his camels and his family if he should break
his word, or give me any trouble. The camel
man swore. An agreement was hastily drawn
up before he had time to change his mind, and a
handsome advance in solid silver was pressed into
his hands to make the agreement good and to
allay his feelings. When requested to sign the
document the camel man, who had sounded
each coin on the doorstep, and to his evident
surprise found them all good, gaily dipped his
thumb into the inkstand and affixed his natural
mark, a fine smudge, upon the valuable paper,
and licked up the surplus ink with his tongue.
The man undertook to provide the necessary
camels and saddles, and to take me across the
Salt Desert in a north-easterly direction, the
only way by which, he said, it was possible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-6" id="Pg_2-6"></a>[<a href="./images/2-6.png">6</a>]</span>
cross the <i>Lut</i>, the year having been rainless, and
nearly all the wells being dry. It would take
from twenty-two to twenty-six days to get
across, and most of the journey would be waterless
or with brackish water. Skins had to be
provided to carry our own supply of water.</p>

<p>A whole day was spent in preparing for the
journey, and when November 4th came, shortly
before midnight my provisions were packed
upon my camels, with an extra load of fowls
and one of fruit, while on the hump of the last
camel of my caravan were perched, in a wooden
box made comfortable with straw and cotton-wool,
two pretty Persian kittens, aged respectively
three weeks and four weeks, which I had
purchased in Kerman, and which, as we shall
see, lived through a great many adventures and
sufferings, and actually reached London safe and
sound, proving themselves to be the most wonderful
and agreeable little travelling companions
imaginable. One was christened "Kerman,"
the other "Zeris."</p>

<p class="figcenter"> <span class="smcap">Kerman and Zeris</span>, the two Kittens who accompanied Author on his wanderings.</p>

<p>The Persian cat, as everybody knows, possesses
a long, soft, silky coat, with a beautiful tail and
ruff, similar to the cats known in Europe as
Angora, which possess probably longer hair on
the body. The Persian cats, too, have a longer
pencil of hair on the ears than domestic cats, and
have somewhat the appearance and the motions
of wild cats, but if properly treated are gentleness
itself, and possess the most marvellous intelligence.
Unlike cats of most other nationalities,
they seem to enjoy moving from place to place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-7" id="Pg_2-7"></a>[<a href="./images/2-7.png">7</a>]</span>
and adapt themselves to fresh localities with the
greatest ease. If fed entirely on plenty of raw
meat and water they are extremely gentle and
affectionate and never wish to leave you; the
reason that many Persian cats&mdash;who still possess
some of the qualities of wild animals&mdash;grow
savage and leave their homes, being principally
because of the lack of raw meat which causes
them to go ahunting to procure it for themselves.
The cat, it should be remembered, is a
carnivorous animal, and is not particularly happy
when fed on a vegetable diet, no more than we
beef-eating people are when invited to a vegetarian
dinner.</p>

<p>Isfahan is the city from which long-haired
Persian cats, the <i>burak</i>, are brought down to the
Gulf, and from there to India, but the Kerman
cats are said by the Persians themselves to be the
best. The white ones are the most appreciated
by the Persians; then the blue (grey) ones with
differently coloured eyes, and the tabby ones.
Mine were, one perfectly white, the other tabby.</p>

<p>At midnight I said good-bye to Major Phillott,
whose kind hospitality I had enjoyed for four
days, and began my slow and dreary march on
camel-back. Swung too and fro till one feels
that one's spine is breaking in two, we wound
our way down from the Consulate at Zeris,
skirted the town, now asleep and in a dead
silence, and then turned north-east among the
barren Kupayeh Mountains.</p>

<p>We had a fine moonlight, and had I been on
a horse instead of a camel I should probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-8" id="Pg_2-8"></a>[<a href="./images/2-8.png">8</a>]</span>
have enjoyed looking at the scenery, but what
with the abnormal Persian dinner to which I
had been treated in the afternoon (see Vol. I.)&mdash;what
with the unpleasant swing of the camel
and the monotonous dingle of the camels' bells&mdash;I
became so very sleepy that I could not keep
my eyes open.</p>

<p>There is very little style to be observed about
riding a camel, and one's only aim must be to be
comfortable, which is easier said than done, for
camels have so many ways of their own, and
these ways are so varied, that it is really difficult
to strike a happy medium.</p>

<p>Sadek had made a kind of spacious platform
on my saddle by piling on it carpets, blankets,
and a mattress, and on the high butt of the
saddle in front he had fastened a pillow folded
in two.</p>

<p>As we wended our way along the foot of one
hill and then another, while nothing particularly
striking appeared in the scenery, I thought I
would utilise what comfort I had within reach,
and resting my head on the pillow, through
which one still felt the hard wooden frame of
the saddle, and with one leg and arm dangling
loose on each side of the saddle, I slept soundly
all through the night. Every now and then the
camel stumbled or gave a sudden jerk, which
nearly made one tumble off the high perch, but
otherwise this was really a delightful way of
passing the long dreary hours of the night.</p>

<p>We marched some nine hours, and having
gone over a low pass across the range, halted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-9" id="Pg_2-9"></a>[<a href="./images/2-9.png">9</a>]</span>
near a tiny spring of fairly good water. Here
we were at the entrance of an extensive valley
with a small village in the centre. Our way,
however, lay to the south-east of the valley
along the mountains. We were at an elevation
of 6,300 feet, or 800 feet above Kerman.</p>

<p>The heat of the day was so great that we
halted, giving the camels a chance of grazing on
what tamarisks they could find during day-light,
for indeed camels are troublesome animals. They
must not eat after sundown or it makes them ill.
They are let loose on arrival at a camp, and they
drift away in search of lichens or other shrubs.
At sunset they are driven back to camp, where
they kneel down and ruminate to their hearts'
content until it is time for the caravan to start.
The heavy wooden saddles with heavy padding
under them are not removed from the camel's
hump while the journey lasts, and each camel
has, among other neck-ornaments of tassels and
shells, one or more brass bells, which are useful
in finding the camels again when strayed too far
in grazing.</p>

<p>We left at midnight and crossed the wide
valley with the village of Sar-es-iap (No. 1) four
miles from our last camp. Again we came
among mountains and entered a narrow gorge.
The night was bitterly cold. We caught up a
large caravan, and the din of the camels' bells
and the hoarse groans of the camels, who were
quite out of breath going up the incline, made
the night a lively one, the sounds being magnified
and echoed from mountain to mountain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-10" id="Pg_2-10"></a>[<a href="./images/2-10.png">10</a>]</span></p>

<p>Every now and then a halt had to be called
to give the camels a rest, and the camel men
spread their felt overcoats upon the ground and
lay down for five or ten minutes to have a sleep.
Then the long string of camels would proceed
again up the hill, the camels urged by the
strange cries and sing-songs of the men.</p>

<p>This part of the journey being mountainous,
one came across three little streams of water, and
at each the camel man urged me to drink as
much as I could, because, he said, the time will
come when we shall see no water at all for days
at a time.</p>

<p>We were gradually rising, the camels panting
dreadfully, and had got up to 7,100 feet when
we camped near the village of Kalaoteh&mdash;a few
small domed hovels, a field or two, and a cluster
of trees along a brook. We were still among
the Kupayeh Mountains with the Kurus peak
towering directly above us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> November 6th we were some fifty miles
from Kerman. Again when midnight came
and I was slumbering hard with the two kittens,
who had made themselves cosy on my blankets,
the hoarse grunts of the camels being brought
up to take the loads woke me up with a start,
and the weird figure of the camel-man stooped
over me to say it was time to depart.</p>

<p>"Hrrrr, hrrrr!" spoke the camel-man to each
camel, by which the animals understood they
must kneel down. The loads were quickly
fastened on the saddles, the kittens lazily
stretched themselves and yawned as they were
removed from their warm nooks, and Sadek
in a moment packed up all my bedding on my
saddle.</p>

<p>We continued to ascend, much to the evident
discomfort of the camels, who were quite unhappy
when going up or down hill. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-12" id="Pg_2-12"></a>[<a href="./images/2-12.png">12</a>]</span>
really ridiculous to see these huge, clumsy
brutes quite done up, even on the gentlest
incline. The track went up and up in zigzag
and curves, the cries of the camel-drivers were
constantly urging on the perplexed animals, and
the dingle of the smaller bells somewhat enlivened
the slow, monotonous ding-dong of the
huge cylindrical bell&mdash;some two and a half feet
high and one foot in diameter&mdash;tied to the load
of the last camel, and mournfully resounding in
the valley down below.</p>

<p>And we swung and swung on the camels'
humps, in the beautiful starlight night&mdash;the
moon had not yet risen&mdash;on several occasions
going across narrow passages with a drop under us
of considerable depth, where one earnestly hoped
the quivering legs of the timid camels would not
give way or perchance stumble. The higher
we got the more the camels panted and roared,
and the cries of the drivers were doubled.</p>

<p>One farsakh and a half from our last camp,
we reached at 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the top of the Godar
Khorassunih Pass (8,400 ft.), and we had to
halt for a while to let the camels rest. The
cold was bitter. Camels and men were trembling
all over. Then came the descent.</p>

<p>Camel riding is comfortable at no time. It is
passable on the flat; just bearable going up hill,
but dreadful going down a fairly steep incline.
The wretched beasts assumed a kind of hopping,
jerky motion on their front legs, with a good
deal of spring in their knees, which bumped the
rider to such an extent that it seemed almost as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-13" id="Pg_2-13"></a>[<a href="./images/2-13.png">13</a>]</span>
if all the bones in one's body began to get disjointed
and rattle. When the camel happened
to stumble among the rocks and loose stones the
sudden jerk was so painful that it took some
seconds to recover from the ache it caused in
one's spine.</p>

<p>The moon rose shortly after we had gone over
the pass, as we were wending our way from one
narrow gorge into another, between high rocks
and cliffs and mountains of most fantastic forms.
We passed the little village of Huruh, and at
dawn the picturesqueness of the scenery increased
tenfold when the cold bluish tints of the moon
gradually vanished in the landscape, and first the
mountains became capped and then lighted all
over with warm, brilliant, reddish tints, their
edge appearing sharply cut against the clear,
glowing, golden sky behind them.</p>

<p>We were now proceeding along a dry, wide
river bed, which had on one side a tiny stream,
a few inches broad, of crystal-like water dripping
along. Evident signs could be noticed that
during the torrential storms of the rainy season
this bed must occasionally carry large volumes of
water. A foot track can be perceived on either
side some twelve feet above the bed, which is
followed by caravans when the river is in
flood.</p>

<p>We now entered a volcanic region with high
perpendicular rocks to our right, that seemed as
if they had undergone the action of long periods
of fire or excessive heat; then we emerged into
a large basin in which the vegetation struck one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-14" id="Pg_2-14"></a>[<a href="./images/2-14.png">14</a>]</span>
as being quite luxuriant by contrast with the
barren country we had come through. There
were a few old and healthy trees on the edge of
the thread of water, and high tamarisks in profusion.
On our left, where the gorge narrowed
again between the mountains, was a large flow of
solid green lava. In this basin was a quaint little
hamlet&mdash;Sar-es-iap (No. 2)&mdash;actually boasting of
a flour-mill, and curious rock dwellings which the
natives inhabit.</p>

<p>We continued, and entered a broader valley,
also of volcanic formation, with reddish sediments
burying a sub-formation of yellowish brown
rock which appeared in the section of the mountains
some 300 feet above the plain. To the
W.N.W. stood a lofty variegated mountain, the
higher part of which was of dark brown in a
horizontal stratum, while the lower was a
slanting layer of deep red.</p>

<p>In the valley there was some cultivation of
wheat, and I noticed some plum, apple, fig and
pomegranate trees. One particularly ancient
tree of enormous proportions stood near the
village, and under its refreshing shade I spent
the day. The village itself&mdash;a quaint castle-like
structure with ruined tower&mdash;was curiously built
in the interior. On the first storey of the large
tower were to be found several humble huts, and
other similar ones stood behind to the north.
These huts were domed and so low as hardly to
allow a person to stand erect inside. Some had
an opening in the dome, most had only a single
aperture, the door. The majority of the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-15" id="Pg_2-15"></a>[<a href="./images/2-15.png">15</a>]</span>habitants
seemed quite derelict and lived in the
most abject poverty.</p>

<p>A few yards north-east of the castle were
some rock habitations. There were three large
chambers dug in the rock side by side, two of
one single room and one of two rooms <i>en suite</i>.
The largest room measured twenty feet by
twelve, and was some six feet high. In the
interior were receptacles apparently for storing
grain. The doorway was quite low, and the
heat inside suffocating. Curiously enough, one
or two of these chambers were not quite
straight, but formed an elbow into the mountain
side.</p>

<p>At the sides of the row of cliff dwellings were
two smaller doors giving access to storehouses
also dug in the rock. I was told that the natives
migrated to this village during the winter months
from October till one month after the Persian
New Year, while they spend the remainder of
the year higher up on the mountains owing to
the intense heat. Firewood, which is scarce, is
stored piled up on the top of roofs, whence a
little at a time is taken down for fuel, and
prominent in front of the village was a coarse
and well-fortified pen for sheep. Wolves were
said to be plentiful in the neighbourhood, and as
I was sitting down writing my notes a shepherd
boy ran into the tower to say that a wolf had
killed one of his sheep.</p>

<p>Both from men and beasts there seemed to be
little safety near the village, according to the
natives, who invariably took their old-fashioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-16" id="Pg_2-16"></a>[<a href="./images/2-16.png">16</a>]</span>
matchlocks with them when they went to work
in their fields, even a few yards away from the
castle.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of this village, which stood at
an altitude of 6,180 feet, was that nobody seemed
to know its name. The people themselves said
that it had no name, but whether they were
afraid of telling me, in their suspicions that some
future evil might come upon them or for other
reasons, I cannot say.</p>

<p>The natives were certainly rather original in
their appearance, their ways and speech, and as I
comfortably sat under the big tree and watched
them coming in and out of the castle-village,
they interested me much. Donkeys in pairs
were taken in and out of the gate to convey
manure to the fields, and old men and young
came in and out carrying their long-poled
spades and matchlocks. Even little boys were
armed.</p>

<p>The men reminded one very forcibly, both in
features and attire, of the figures in ancient
Egyptian sculptures, of which they were the
very image. They wore felt skull caps, the side
locks of jet black hair cut straight across. They
had clean-shaven necks and lumpy black beards.
Their tall bodies were slender, with short waists,
and their wiry feet showed beneath ample
trousers&mdash;so ample as almost to approach a
divided skirt. The children were pretty, and
although miserably clothed looked the very
picture of health and suppleness.</p>

<p>The women, of whom a number sat the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-17" id="Pg_2-17"></a>[<a href="./images/2-17.png">17</a>]</span>
day perched on the domed roofs of their huts to
watch the doings of the <i>ferenghi</i>, showed their
faces fully, and although professing to be Mussulman
made no attempt whatever at concealment.
They wore picturesque light blue and red
kerchiefs on the head and shoulders, falling
into a point behind, and held fast in position
round the skull by a small black and blue
turban. A pin held the two sides of the
kerchief together under the chin. The women
were garbed in short, pleated blue skirts reaching
just below the knee, and a short loose coat of
the same cotton material with side slits and
ample sleeves. They had bare legs, well proportioned
and straight, with handsome ankles
and long, well-formed feet and toes. When
working they went about bare-footed, but when
their daily occupations were finished put on small
slippers.</p>

<p>They were particularly to be admired when
they walked, which they did to perfection, looking
most attractively picturesque when carrying
jugs of water on the head. The head had to be
then kept very erect, and gave a becoming curve
to the well-modelled neck and a most graceful
swing to the waist. A long black cloak, not
unlike a <i>chudder</i>, was worn over the head after
sunset when the air was turning cold.</p>

<p>The women did all the hard work and seemed
to put their whole soul into it. Some gaily
spun wool on their wheels, and others worked at
small, neat, but primitive weaving looms which
were erected on the top storey of the castle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-18" id="Pg_2-18"></a>[<a href="./images/2-18.png">18</a>]</span></p>

<p>Affectionate mothers carefully searched the
hair of the heads of their children&mdash;to remove
therefrom all superfluous animal life,&mdash;but to
my dismay I discovered that their good-nature
went so far as not to destroy the captured brutes,
which were merely picked up most gently, so
as not to injure them, and flung down from the
castle-village wall, on the top of which this
operation took place. As there were other
people sitting quite unconcerned down below,
no doubt this provided a good deal of perpetual
occupation to the women of the castle, and the
parasites were provided with a constant change
of abode.</p>

<p>Probably what astonished me most was to see
a young damsel climb up a tall tree in the best
monkey fashion, with successively superposed
arms and legs stiff and straight, not round the
tree, mind you, and using her toes for the purpose
with almost equal ease as her fingers.</p>

<p>The foot-gear of the men was interesting.
They wore wooden-soled clogs, held fast to the
foot by a string between the big toe and the
next, and another band half way across the foot.
Some of the men, however, wore common shoes
with wooden soles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> we left camp shortly before midnight, and
ascended continually between mountains until we
reached a pass 7,250 ft. above the sea, after which
we came upon the abandoned caravanserai of
Abid (pronounced Obit). On descending, the
way was between high vertical rocks, and then
we found ourselves among hills of most peculiar
formation. The sun was about to rise, and the
fantastic hill-tops, in some places not unlike
sharp teeth of a gigantic saw, in others recalled
Stonehenge and the pillar-like remains of temples
of Druids. In this case they were, of
course, entirely of natural formation. Although
there was no water in the valley into which we
had descended, we camped here owing to the
camels being very tired, and I took the opportunity
of climbing to a neighbouring hill (6,300
ft.) in order to obtain a panoramic view of the
surrounding country.</p>

<p>To the South-East, whence we had come, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-20" id="Pg_2-20"></a>[<a href="./images/2-20.png">20</a>]</span>
low and comparatively well-rounded mountains
with two narrow valleys separated by a flat-topped,
tortuous hill range. To the north-east of my
camp was a high and most impressive mountain,
the upper portion of which appeared at first
almost of a basaltic formation, with vertical
quadrangular columns, while the lower portion
of the mountain, evidently accumulated at a later
period, and slanting at an angle of 45&deg;, displayed
distinct strata of light brown, a deep band of
grey, then dark brown, light brown, a thin layer
of grey, and then a gradation of beautiful warm
burnt sienna colour, getting richer and richer in
tone towards the base. Here at the bottom, all
round the mountain, and in appearance not unlike
the waves of a choppy sea in shallow water, rose
hundreds of broken-up, pointed hillocks, the
point of each hillock being invariably turned in
a direction away from the mountain, and these
were formed not of sand, but by a much broken-up
stratum of black, burnt slate, at an angle of
20&deg; in relation to an imaginary horizontal plane.</p>

<p class="illc">Author's Caravan and Others Halting in the Desert.</p>

<p>It was most curious to find these enormous
layers of black slate here, for they were quite
different in character from the whole country
around. About two miles further off, north-east,
we had, for instance, a range of mountains
of quite a different type, not at all broken up
nor with sharp cutting edges, but quite nicely
rounded off. Between this range and the high
peculiar mountain which I have just described&mdash;in
the flat stretch&mdash;were to be seen some curious
hillocks, apparently formed by water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-21" id="Pg_2-21"></a>[<a href="./images/2-21.png">21</a>]</span></p>

<p>N.N.E. was the way towards Birjand, first
across a long flat plain bounded before us by low
greyish hills, beyond which a high mountain-range&mdash;the
Leker Kuh&mdash;towered sublime. Two
mountain masses of fair height stood in front of
this range, one N.N.E. on the left of the track,
the other N.N.W., with a white sediment of salt
at its base; while beyond could be distinguished
a long flat-topped mountain with a peculiar white
horizontal band half way up it, like a huge chalk
mark, all along its entire length of several miles.
This mountain appeared to be some thirty miles
off. The mountain mass to the N.W. showed no
picturesque characteristics, but a more broken-up
mountain, somewhat similar to the one to our
N.E., stood between my camp and the range
beyond.</p>

<p>As I have already stated, we had come along a
dry river bed, and from my high point of vantage
I could see its entire course to the north-west.
It ran in a tortuous manner until it absolutely
lost itself in the flat desert. The long snake-like
hill-range separating the parallel valleys from
south-east to north-west appeared to owe its
formation to the action of water, the surface
pebbles, even at the summit of it, being well
rounded and worn quite smooth, many with
grooves in them.</p>

<p>Near my camp I came across some very curious
imprints in the hard rock, like lava. There
were some rocks hollowed out, in a fantastic
way, as if the hollows had been formed by some
softer matter having been enclosed in the rock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-22" id="Pg_2-22"></a>[<a href="./images/2-22.png">22</a>]</span>
and having gradually disappeared, and also a
perfect cast of a large tibia bone. On other
rocks were footprints of large animals, evidently
made when the lava was soft.</p>

<p>On returning to camp I found a general row
going on between Sadek and the camel men&mdash;my
own and those of the other caravan who had
asked permission to travel with me. There was
no water at this camp, and only salt water could
be procured in small quantities some distance
away. The intense heat had played havoc with
some of my fresh provisions, and we unfortunately
had an accident to the load of eggs which were
all destroyed. A great many of the chickens,
too, had gone bad, and we were running rather
short of fresh food. The caravan men said that
it was impossible to go on, because, this being
such a dry year, even the few brackish wells
across the desert would be dry, and they refused
to come on.</p>

<p>The greater part of the evening was spent in
arguing&mdash;everybody except myself shouting himself
hoarse. At midnight, the usual hour of our
departure, the camel men refused to pack the
loads and continue across the desert. At 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
they were preparing to leave me to return
to Kerman. At 1.30, my patience being on the
verge of being exhausted, they most of them
received a good pounding with the butt of my
rifle. At 1.45, they having come back to their
senses, I duly entertained each of them to a cup
of tea, brewed with what salt water we had got,
on a fire of camel dung, and at 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-23" id="Pg_2-23"></a>[<a href="./images/2-23.png">23</a>]</span>ceeded
on our course as quietly as possible as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>We still followed the dry river bed among
hills getting lower and lower for about three
miles on either side of us, and at last we entered
a vast plain. We went N.N.W. for some twelve
miles, when by the side of some low hillocks of
sand and pebbles we came upon a caravanserai, and
an older and smaller structure, a large covered tank
of rain water (almost empty) which is conveyed
here from the hills twelve miles off by means of
a small canal.</p>

<p>To the S.S.E. we could still see the flat-topped
mountain under which we had camped the
previous day, and all around us were distant mountains.
The flat plain stretching for miles on
every side had deep grooves cut into it by water
flowing down from the mountain-side during the
torrential rains and eventually losing themselves
in the sand.</p>

<p>On the English and some of the German maps
these dry grooves are marked as large and important
rivers, but this is a mistake. There is
not a drop of water in any of them at any time
of the year except during heavy storms, when the
drainage of the mountains is immediately carried
down by these channels and lost in the desert. It
is no more right to mark these channels as rivers
than it would be to see Piccadilly marked on a
map of London as a foaming torrent because
during a heavy shower the surplus water not
absorbed by the wood pavement had run down
it half an inch deep until the rain stopped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-24" id="Pg_2-24"></a>[<a href="./images/2-24.png">24</a>]</span></p>

<p>To the N.E. we saw much more clearly than
the day before the extensive salt deposits at the
base of the mountains, and to the N.N.E. a
grey mountain with a fluted top. A high
mountain mass stretched from the South to the
North-West and then there was a wide
opening into another flat sandy plain. Far, far
beyond this a distant range of high mountains
could hardly be distinguished, for a sand-storm
was raging in that direction and veiled the view
with a curtain of dirty yellowish grey.</p>

<p>This caravanserai, called Haoz Panch (or
"Fifth water") altitude 5,050 feet&mdash;was built
by some charitable person to protect caravans
during sand-storms, and also to supply them with
water, which was quite drinkable, if one were
not too particular, and if one did not look at it.
The caravanserai, very solidly built, was left to
take care of itself, there being no one in charge
of it. The <i>kilns</i> erected to bake the bricks with
which the caravanserai had been built, still stood
near it.</p>

<p>It is rather curious to notice what effect a
drink of fair water has on the temper of one's
men. My camel man, Ali Murat, for that was
his name, was in high spirits and came to fetch
me to show me how he made his bread, for he
was keen to know whether camel men(!) in my
country made it the same way! I reserved my
answer until I had seen his process.</p>

<p>The hands having been carefully washed first,
flour and water, with great lumps of salt, were
duly mixed together in a bowl until reduced into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-25" id="Pg_2-25"></a>[<a href="./images/2-25.png">25</a>]</span>
fairly solid paste. A clean cloth was then
spread upon the ground and the paste punched
hard upon it with the knuckles, care having been
taken to sprinkle some dry flour first so that the
paste should not stick to the cloth. When this
had gone on for a considerable time the paste
was balanced upon the knuckles and brought
gaily bounding to where the hot cinders remained
from a fire of camel dung which had
previously been lighted. The flattened paste
was carefully laid upon the hot ashes, with
which it was then covered, and left to bake for
an hour or so.</p>

<p>When ready, Ali Murat brought me a piece
of the bread to try&mdash;which I reluctantly did so
as not to offend his feelings.</p>

<p>"Do camel men in your country, Sahib, make
as good bread as this when they cross the <i>lut</i>
(desert)?" inquired Ali Murat, with an expectant
grin from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"We have no camel men in my country, and
no camels, and no <i>lut</i>! How could we then get
as good bread as yours?" (Really, when one
tried to forget the process of making it, which
did not quite appeal to one, the bread was not
bad.)</p>

<p>"You have no camels, sahib,&mdash;no <i>lut</i>&mdash;in your
country?" exclaimed Ali, with his eyes fast
expanding with surprise; "Why, then, did you
come here?"</p>

<p>"We have so much scenery in my country
that I thought I would come here for a
change."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-26" id="Pg_2-26"></a>[<a href="./images/2-26.png">26</a>]</span></p>

<p>We left the caravanserai at 11.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on
November 9th and travelled across the plain all
through the night. About 4 miles from Haoz
Panch we found an ancient mud caravanserai
abandoned and partly ruined. We had the hills
quite close on our right and we came across a
good many dry channels cut by water. We
travelled on the flat all the time, but we passed
on either side a great many low mounds
of sand and gravel. There was absolutely
nothing worth noticing in the night's journey
until we came to the small villages of Heirabad
and Shoshabad, eighteen miles from our
last camp. Two miles further we found ourselves
at Lawah (Rawar)&mdash;altitude 4,430 feet&mdash;a
very large oasis with a small town of some
three thousand mud huts and ten thousand inhabitants,
according to native accounts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lawah</span> or Rawar is, in a way, quite an important
centre. It is the last place one passes
before entering the Salt Desert proper, on the
border of which it is situated, and is, therefore,
the last spot where provisions and good water
can be obtained. It has a certain amount of
local trade and is connected with Yezd by a very
tortuous track <i>via</i> Bafk-Kuh-Benan. It has no
possible resting place, and we therefore camped
just outside the town. The natives were not
particularly friendly and seemed inclined to give
trouble. There was considerable excitement
when we crossed the town in the morning on
our arrival, and even more when I went to
inspect the city alone in the afternoon.</p>

<p>There was nothing to see, the bazaar in the
place being one of the most miserable looking
in Persia. It was not domed over like those of
other Persian cities, but the streets were merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-28" id="Pg_2-28"></a>[<a href="./images/2-28.png">28</a>]</span>
covered with rafters supporting brush wood and
rotten mats. There were no shops proper, but
various merchants, and brass-smiths, fruit-sellers,
or sellers of articles for caravans, had a certain
amount of cheap goods within their habitation
doors.</p>

<p>More quaintly interesting were the commercial
caravanserais, or small squares with
receptacles all round for travelling merchants
to display their goods upon. Lawah's trade is
principally a transit trade, the caravans which
occasionally come through the desert taking an
opportunity of selling off some of their goods
here, as also, of course, do those that come from
Yezd or Kerman.</p>

<p>There is some cultivation of wheat and cotton
in the immediate neighbourhood, and of fruit,
which is quite excellent. The water is not very
plentiful, as can be seen by the hundreds of
borings for water and disused <i>kanats</i> to the north
of the city, where most fields are to be found,
while the majority of fruit gardens and trees are
to the east.</p>

<p>Here, as everywhere else in Persia, a great
portion of the town is uninhabited and in ruins,
and to the south-west, outside the inhabited part,
can be seen an interesting ruined quadrangular
castle with a double wall and moat with an
outer watch tower besides the corner turrets.
Inside this castle was formerly a village. Another
smaller fort, also in ruins, is situated to the
S.S.W.</p>

<p>There are a great many palm trees within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-29" id="Pg_2-29"></a>[<a href="./images/2-29.png">29</a>]</span>
the place, and they produce good dates. The
climate is most unhealthy, fever of the desert
being rampant. Great use is made of opium,
which is smoked to excess by the natives and
has very disastrous effects in such an unhealthy
climate. Personally, I have ever believed, and
believe still, that opium used in moderation has
no worse effects upon the light-headed human
beings who choose to make themselves slaves to
it than whisky or tobacco, but under these particular
circumstances and in this particular climate
it had undoubtedly most evil effects in just
the same way that whisky, which is certainly
the best drink for damp Scotland, is most
injurious to those who make use of it in similar
doses in India.</p>

<p>Although I have visited opium dens, merely
for the purpose of observing, in almost every
Asiatic country where opium smoking is practised,
I have never seen cases quite so depressing
as here. A great proportion of the population
suffered from fever, to allay the sufferings of
which opium was used.</p>

<p>There was, of course, the usual contingent
of sick people visiting my camp to obtain medicine
for their various troubles&mdash;one fever-stricken
man, with cadaverous face and skeleton-like limbs,
collapsing altogether when reaching me and remaining
senseless for a considerable time. As I
never carry medicine of any kind in my travels
I was unable to satisfy them, but I gave them
some little present each, which did them just as
much good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-30" id="Pg_2-30"></a>[<a href="./images/2-30.png">30</a>]</span></p>

<p>Beggars, too, visited the camp in appalling
numbers, and their ways were quite interesting;
but none was so ingenious as that of an old woman,
who waited till there was a goodish crowd of
visitors in my camp, and then rushed at me and
made a violent scene, saying that I must pay her
50 tomans&mdash;about &pound;10.</p>

<p>"But I have never seen you before! What
have you done to earn such a sum?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sahib, you have ruined me!" and she
yelled as only an angry old woman can! She
plumped herself on my best carpet and proceeded
to explain. She said that she had buried the
above stated sum in solid silver within a pile of
straw, which she had sold the day before to a
man to feed his camels upon. She was therefore&mdash;according
to a reasoning of her own, since
I had not yet arrived here the day before, nor
could she identify the man with any of my party&mdash;certain
that my camels had devoured the sum,
and I, therefore, must pay the sum back! She
was, nevertheless, sure that I was not to blame
in the matter, and was willing to waive the claim
on the immediate payment of two shais&mdash;about
a half-penny!</p>

<p>Although it is well to be as kind as one can to
the natives, it is never right to allow them to go
unpunished for playing tricks. Of all the people&mdash;and
they were many&mdash;who applied for charity
that day, she was the only one who received
nothing. This punishment, I was glad to see,
was approved of by the many natives who had
collected round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-31" id="Pg_2-31"></a>[<a href="./images/2-31.png">31</a>]</span></p>

<p>A gentlemanly-looking fellow came forward
and asked me to visit his house, where he was
manufacturing a huge carpet&mdash;very handsome in
design, but somewhat coarse in texture&mdash;ordered
for Turkestan. Three women in his house had
uncovered faces, and were very good-looking.
They brought us tea in the garden, and sweets
and water melon, but did not, of course, join in
the conversation, and modestly kept apart in a
corner. They wore white <i>chudders</i> over the
head and long petticoats&mdash;quite a becoming
attire&mdash;while the men, too, were most artistic
in appearance, with smart zouave yellow jackets
trimmed with fur, with short sleeves not reaching
quite to the elbow, leaving the arm quite free in
its movements, and displaying the loose sleeve of
the shirt underneath.</p>

<p>A couple of newly-born babies were swung in
hammocks in the garden, and were remarkably
quiet when asleep!</p>

<p>On going for a walk on the outskirts of the
city one found a great many fairly high mud hillocks
to the east, averaging 400 feet. East-south-east
there stood hundreds more of these hillocks,
with taller brown hills (the Leker Kuh) behind
them, and to the west a high peak, rising to an
estimated 11,000 feet, in the Kuh-Benan mountains.
The Tokrajie Mountains, south-west of
Lawah, did not seem to rise to more than 9,000
or 10,000 feet, and extended in a south-south-east
direction. South-east we could still see the
Kuh Legav Mountain, at the foot of which we
had camped on November 8th. To the north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-32" id="Pg_2-32"></a>[<a href="./images/2-32.png">32</a>]</span>
was a long mountain, with a white stratum like
a horizontal stripe half-way up it, and the summit
was in regular teeth like those of a saw. Another
similar but more pointed mountain was to the east-south-east,
the white stratum being less horizontal
in this portion. This curious white stripe in
the hills extended over an arc of a circle from
70&deg; (east-north-east) to 320&deg; (north-west).</p>

<p>We made great purchases of provisions in
Lawah&mdash;sheep, chickens, eggs, vegetables and
fruit, the slaughtered chickens being carefully
prepared in layers of salt to make them last as
long as possible. Then we purchased a number
of sheep skins to carry a further supply of
drinking water, for from this place, we were told,
we should be several days without finding any.
Sadek was busy all day smearing these skins with
molten butter to make them absolutely water
tight, and I, on my part, was glad to see all the
butter go in this operation, for with the intense
heat of the day it was impossible to touch it
with one's food. Sadek's idea of good cooking
was intense richness&mdash;everything floating in
grease and butter; so these skins, which absorbed
all the butter we had, were really a godsend to
me&mdash;as far as the <i>cuisine</i> of the future was
concerned.</p>

<p>There was something in the climate of Lawah
that made one feverish and irritable. In the
afternoon some of the camel men had a fight
with a number of Lawah people, and later the
camel men in a body attacked Sadek. He was
very plucky and quick&mdash;they were heavy but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-33" id="Pg_2-33"></a>[<a href="./images/2-33.png">33</a>]</span>
clumsy&mdash;so that Sadek succeeded with a heavy
mallet in giving them several cracks on the
head, but as they were eight to one and closed
in upon him and were about to give him a good
hammering, I had to rush to his assistance and
with the butt of my rifle scattered the lot about.
For a moment they seemed as if they were going
to turn on me; they were very excited and
seized whatever they could lay their hands upon
in the shape of sticks and stones, but I casually
put a few cartridges in the magazine of my rifle
and sat down again on my carpets to continue
writing my diary. They came to beg pardon
for the trouble they had given, and embraced
my feet, professing great humility.</p>

<p>Four camels of the combined caravans had
been taken ill with fever and had to be left
behind. Their cries from pain were pitiful.
Owing to the abundant dinner we got here, with
lavish supplies of meat, fruit&mdash;most delicious
figs, pomegranates and water melons&mdash;of which
we partook more copiously than wisely, all the
men got attacks of indigestion, and so did my
poor little kittens, who had stuffed themselves
to their hearts' content with milk and the
insides of chickens; so that when night came,
everybody being ill, we were unable to make a
start.</p>

<p>At sunset, with the sudden change in the
temperature, and the revulsion from intense
dryness to the sudden moisture of the dew, a
peculiar feeling took possession of me, and I
could feel that I was fast inhaling the miasma of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-34" id="Pg_2-34"></a>[<a href="./images/2-34.png">34</a>]</span>
fever. The natives shut themselves up inside
their houses&mdash;for sunset, they say, and sunrise
are the times when fever is contracted,&mdash;but we
were out in the open and had no protection
against it. It seems to seize one violently from
the very beginning and sends up one's temperature
extremely high, which produces a fearful exhaustion,
with pains in the ribs, arms and spinal
column.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-007.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-007_th.jpg" alt="Wolves in Camp." title="Wolves in Camp." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Wolves in Camp.</p>

<p>The altitude of Lawah is 4,420 ft. and therefore
the nights are terribly cold in contrast to
the stifling heat of the day. I had wrapped
myself up in my blankets, shivering with the
fever that had seized me quite violently, and the
kittens were playing about near my bed. My
men were all sound asleep and only the occasional
hoarse roar of the squatted camels all round our
camp broke the silence of the night. I eventually
fell asleep with my hat over my face
screening it from the heavy fall of dew.</p>

<p>Suddenly I woke up, startled by the kittens
dashing under my blankets and sticking their
claws into me and making a fearful racket, and
also by some other animals sniffing my face. I
jumped up, rifle in hand, for indeed there were
some wolves visiting our camp. One&mdash;a most
impudent rascal&mdash;was standing on one of my
boxes, and another had evidently made a dash for
the white cat; hence the commotion.</p>

<p>The wolves bolted when I got up&mdash;I could
not fire owing to the camels and people being
all round&mdash;but the kittens did not stir from their
hiding place until the next morning, when in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-35" id="Pg_2-35"></a>[<a href="./images/2-35.png">35</a>]</span>
broad day-light they cautiously peeped out to
see that the danger had passed.</p>

<p>With the coming day the gruesome reality
had to be faced, that one and all of my party had
contracted fever of the desert in more or less
violent form, even the kittens, who sneezed and
trembled the whole day. Some of the camels,
too, were unwell and lay with their long necks
resting upon the ground and refused to eat. The
prospects of crossing the most difficult part of
the desert with such a sorry party were not very
bright, but we made everything ready, and at ten
o'clock in the evening we were to make a start.</p>

<p>I purchased here a third and most beautiful
cat&mdash;a weird animal, and so wild that when let
out of the bag in which it had been brought to
me, he covered us all over with scratches. He
was three months old, and had quite a will of
his own. When introduced to Master Kerman
and Miss Zeris, there were reciprocal growls and
arched backs, and when asked to share their
travelling home for the night there was evident
objection and some exchange of spitting. But
as there were four corners in the wooden box
and only three cats, they eventually settled down,
one in each, watching the new comer with wide
expanded eyes and fully outstretched claws, merely
for defensive emergencies, but otherwise quite
peacefully inclined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> November 11th at ten o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we gladly
left poisonous Lawah and spent the night (November
12th) traversing a mountain region by a
flattish and low pass, and then travelling due
north entered the actual <i>Dasht-i-lut</i>&mdash;the sandy
Salt Desert, the sediment of surface salt being
in some places so thick and white as to resemble
snow. Here and there some hillocks of sand
relieved the monotony of the dreary journey,
otherwise flat sand and surface salt extended as
far as the eye could see.</p>

<p>The nights, even when there was no moonlight,
were so clear, and the stars and planets so brilliant,
that with a little practice one could, for general
purposes, see almost as well as by day.</p>

<p>The night was terribly cold, which I felt all
the more owing to the fever, as I hung resting
my head on the padded pommel of the saddle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-37" id="Pg_2-37"></a>[<a href="./images/2-37.png">37</a>]</span>
and my legs and arms dangling at the sides. A
howling, cutting wind blew and made it impossible
to cover one's self up with blankets, as
they were constantly being blown away, no
matter how well one tucked one's self in them.</p>

<p>There was a certain picturesque weirdness in
these night marches in the desert&mdash;when one
could dissociate one's self from the discomforts.
The camel men had some sad, plaintive
songs of their own&mdash;quite melodious and in good
tune with the accompaniment of dingling bells
hanging from the camels' necks. There was
a musician in our party&mdash;Ali Murat's young
brother&mdash;who carried a flute in his girdle during
the day, but played upon the instrument the
whole night&mdash;some doleful tunes of his own
composition, which were not bad. True, when
one had listened to the same tune, not only scores
but hundreds of times during one night, one
rather felt the need of a change, but still even
the sound of his flute was a great relief in the
dreary night marches. Occasionally, when the
fancy took him, and he made some variations in
the airs, the camel men, who slept while mechanically
walking, would join in to sing in a
chorus.</p>

<p>Overhead the stars gleamed with a brightness
that we can never dream of seeing in Europe,
and in the distance we now began to perceive
some phantom-like hills rising from the whitish-grey
surface of the desert. A good deal of the
poetry of the desert is, nevertheless, lost each
time that the camel on which you ride breathes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-38" id="Pg_2-38"></a>[<a href="./images/2-38.png">38</a>]</span>
Behold! one is brought to earth very soon!
The rancid smell which comes in regular whiffs
is sickening. So is the powerful stench of his
hump when it gets heated by the pads of the
never-removed saddle.</p>

<p>About every two miles a few minutes' rest is
given to the camels, then on again they slowly
swing forward, the nose of one being attached
by a long string to the tail rope of the preceding
animal.</p>

<p>Twenty miles from Lawah, mud-hills covering
underlying rock were reached, and closed us in on
either side. Two miles further, when it got too
hot to proceed&mdash;thermometer 148&deg; in the sun
and not a thread of shade&mdash;we halted on a white
salt deposit of considerable extent. There was
no water and no fuel, and the heat was well-nigh
unbearable in the middle of the day. It was
useless to pitch my tent, for in such stifling heat
it is not possible to remain under it, nor could
one breathe at all if one tried to get a little shade
by screening one's self against a wall of loads
which impeded the air moving.</p>

<p>My camel men showed me a device which by
the ignorant may be ridiculed, but to the sensible
is a great blessing when exposed to abnormally
high temperatures. The only way to protect
one's self against the broiling air is to cover one's
self, head and all, leaving space to breathe, with
one or two thick blankets of wool or thick felt, of
a white or light colour preferably, white being a
non-absorbent of the hot sun's rays. The thickness
of the cloth keeps the body at an enveloping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-39" id="Pg_2-39"></a>[<a href="./images/2-39.png">39</a>]</span>
temperature slightly above the temperature of
the body itself (even when with high fever
seldom more than 104&deg;), and therefore a cooler
temperature than outside the blankets, when it is
frequently 148&deg; sometimes 150&deg; and even more.
By contrast this seems quite cool. It is, in other
words, a similar process to that used by us in
summer to maintain ice from melting.</p>

<p>In Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Arabia, the people
who are much exposed to the rays of the hot sun
in deserts always wear extremely thick woollen
clothing, or bernouses; and in Persia the camel
men of the desert, as we have seen, possess thick
white felt coats in which they wrap themselves,
head and all, during the hot hours of the day.
The Italians, too, seem to have been fully aware
of this, for in Naples and Southern Italy they
have an ancient proverb in the Neapolitan dialect:&mdash;<i>Quel
che para lo freddo para lo caldo</i>&mdash;"What
is protection against cold is protection against
heat."</p>

<p>I know one Englishman in Southern Persia
who, when crossing the broiling plains of
Arabistan, wears a thick overcoat and plenty of
woollen underwear&mdash;a method which he learnt
from the nomad tribes of Arabistan&mdash;but he is
generally laughed at by his countrymen who do
not know any better. This cooling device,
naturally, only applies to tropical climates when
the temperature of the air is greatly above the
actual temperature of the blood.</p>

<p>I had arranged with the caravan that accompanied
mine to carry fodder for my camels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-40" id="Pg_2-40"></a>[<a href="./images/2-40.png">40</a>]</span>
as there was no grazing for the animals here.
Large cloths were spread on which straw and
cotton-seeds were mixed together, and then the
camels were made to kneel round and have a meal.</p>

<p>On this occasion I was much struck by the
really marvellous intelligence of cats. We hear
a lot about dogs finding their way home from
long distances by using their sense of scent (how
far this explanation is correct we have no time to
discuss), but of cats the general belief is that if
they are taken away from home they seldom find
their way back. This may be the case with cats
that have always been shut up in some particular
house, but it is not that they do not possess the
intellect to do so in their natural state. Here is
an instance.</p>

<p>On letting the cats loose when we halted, the
newly-purchased one attempted to make his
escape. I was watching him carefully. He did
not do this in a haphazard manner, running here
and there as a dog would, but jumped out of the
box, took his bearings with great calm and
precision and in a most scientific manner, first by
looking at the sun, and then at his own shadow,
evidently to discover whether when shut up in
the box he had travelled east or west, north or
south, or to some intermediate point. He repeated
this operation several times with a
wonderful expression of intelligence and reflection
on his little face, and then dashed away with
astounding accuracy in the direction of Lawah
town. Mind you, he did not at all follow the
track that we had come by, which was somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-41" id="Pg_2-41"></a>[<a href="./images/2-41.png">41</a>]</span>
circuitous, but went in a bee line for his native
place and not a second to the left or right of the
direct bearings which I took with my prismatic
compass to check his direction. Sadek and the
camel men went in pursuit of him and he was
brought back.</p>

<p>This seemed so marvellous that I thought it
might be a chance. We were then only twenty-two
miles from Lawah. I repeated the experiment
for three or four days from subsequent camps,
until the cat reconciled himself to his new
position and declined to run away. I took the
trouble to revolve him round himself several
times to mislead him in his bearings, but each
time he found his correct position by the sun and
his own shadow, and never made a mistake in
the absolutely correct bearings of his route.</p>

<p>A remarkable fact in connection with this is
that the most ignorant natives of Persia, men
who have never seen or heard of a compass, can
tell you the exact direction of places by a very
similar method, so that there is more in the
process than we think.</p>

<p>It is rather humiliating when we reflect that
what we highly civilised people can only do with
difficulty with the assistance of elaborate theodolites,
sextants, artificial horizons, compasses
and lengthy computations, an ignorant camel
man, or a kitten, can do practically and simply
and always correctly in a few seconds by drawing
conclusions on facts of nature which speak for
themselves better than all the scientific instruments
we can manufacture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-42" id="Pg_2-42"></a>[<a href="./images/2-42.png">42</a>]</span></p>

<p>There was a high mountain north-east of
camp, the Darband, 8,200 feet, and as my fever
seemed to be getting worse, and I had no
quinine with which to put a sudden stop to it, I
thought I would climb to the top of the
mountain to sweat the fever out, and also to
obtain a view of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>After having slept some three hours and
having partaken of a meal&mdash;we had the greatest
difficulty in raising enough animal fuel for a fire&mdash;I
started off about one in the afternoon under
a broiling sun. The camp was at an altitude of
4,350 feet and the ascent not difficult but very
steep and rocky, and involving therefore a good
deal of violent exertion. The dark rocks were
so hot with the sun that had been shining upon
them that they nearly burned one's fingers when
one touched them. Still, the view from the top
well repaid one for the trouble of getting there.</p>

<p>A general survey showed that the highest
mountain to be seen around was to the south-south-east
(150&deg; bearings magnetic), and a
couple of almost conical hills, exactly alike in
shape, but not in size, stood one in front of the
other on a line with 160&deg; b.m. Between them
both to east and west were a number of misshapen
mountains. Were it not for a low confused heap
of grey mud and sand the desert would be an
absolutely flat stretch from the distant mountains
enclosing the plain on the south to the others
on the north. A long high mud barrier runs
diagonally at the northern end, in a direction from
east to west, and another extending from south-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-43" id="Pg_2-43"></a>[<a href="./images/2-43.png">43</a>]</span>east
to north-west meets it, forming a slightly
acute angle. The latter range is of a most peculiar
formation, extremely brilliant in colour, the
ground being a vivid red, regularly fluted and
striped across so straight with friezes and bands
formed by strata of different tones of colour, that
from a distance it almost resembles the patient
work of a skilful artisan instead of the results
of the corrosive action of water. Another
parallel and similar range stands exactly opposite
on the east.</p>

<p>The mountain itself to which I had climbed
was most interesting. Imbedded in the rock
were quantities of fossil white and black sea-shells,
and about half way up the mountain a
huge fossil, much damaged, resembling a gigantic
turtle. Near it on the rock were impressions
of enormous paws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we left camp soon after midnight on
November 13th, we had to make quite a long
detour to take the caravan around the Darband
Mountain, which barred our way directly on the
course we were to follow. On foot one could
have taken a short cut in a more direct line by
climbing up to a certain height on the western
mountain slope, but it was out of the question
to take camels up by it. We had to go some
distance due north, through very broken country
with numerous hillocks, after which we followed
a narrow gorge cut deep by the action of water.
The sides of this gorge were like high mud and
gravel walls, occasionally rocks worn smooth,
averaging from 60 to 100 feet apart.</p>

<p>The river bed, now absolutely dry, evidently
carried into the desert during the torrential rain all
the drainage of the mountainous country we had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-45" id="Pg_2-45"></a>[<a href="./images/2-45.png">45</a>]</span>
traversed, practically that from Abid, the Leker
Mountains, and the combined flow of the Lawah
plain from the mountains to the west of it, to
which, of course, may be added the western
watershed of the Darband Mountain itself. A
glance at the natural walls, between which we
were travelling, and the way in which hard rocks
had been partly eaten away and deeply grooved,
or huge hollows bored into them, was sufficient
to show the observer with what terrific force the
water must dash its way through this deep-cut
channel. The highest water-mark noticeable on
the sides was twenty-five feet above the bed.
The impetus with which the rain water must
flow down the almost vertical fluted mountain
sides must be very great, and immense also must
be the body of water carried, for the mountain
sides, being rocky, absorb very little of the rain
falling upon them and let it flow down to increase
the foaming stream&mdash;when it is a stream.</p>

<p>Some sixteen miles from our last camp we
came across a circular tower, very solidly built,
standing on the edge of a river cliff, and higher
up on a ridge of hills in a commanding position
stood the remains of two quadrangular towers in
a tumbling-down condition. Of one, in fact,
there remained but a portion of the base; of the
other three walls were still standing to a good
height. The circular tower below, however,
which seemed of later date, was in good
preservation. According to the camel men, none
of these towers were very ancient and had been
put up to protect that passage from the robber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-46" id="Pg_2-46"></a>[<a href="./images/2-46.png">46</a>]</span>
bands which occasionally came over westward
from Sistan and Afghanistan. It had, however,
proved impossible to maintain a guard in such
a desolate position, hence the abandonment of
these outposts.</p>

<p>This is one of the three principal passages by
which the mountains can be crossed with animals
from Kerman towards the east (north of the
latitude of Kerman 30&deg; 17&#8242; 30&#8243;). The other
two passages are: one to Khabis over a pass
(north-east of Kerman) in the Husseinabad
Mountains; the second between the Derun
Mountain and the Leker Kuh from Abid, also
to Khabis. From the latter place it is also
possible to cross the Desert to Birjiand, but the
lack of water even at the best of times makes
it a very dangerous track to follow both for men
and animals. Barring these passages there are
high mountains protecting Kerman and continuously
extending, roughly, from N.N.W. to
S.S.E.</p>

<p>We travelled partly above the high cliffs,
then, near the circular tower, we descended to
the dry river-bed of well-rounded pebbles and
sand. Our course had gradually swerved to
the south-east, then we left the river bed once
more and went due east, over confused masses
of mud hillocks from twenty to a hundred feet
high. To the north we had a wall-like mountain
range formed of superposed triangles of
semi-solidified rock, the upper point of each
triangle forming either an angle of 45&deg; or a
slightly acute angle; and to the south also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-47" id="Pg_2-47"></a>[<a href="./images/2-47.png">47</a>]</span>
another wall-like range, quite low, but of a
similar character to the northern ones. Beyond
it, to the south-west, twenty miles back (by the
way followed) lay the Darband Mountain, on
the other side of which we had made our
previous camp.</p>

<p>The camp at which we halted bore the name
of Darband, and from this point the desert again
opened into a wide flat expanse. The mountains
to the north suddenly ended in a crowded
succession of low mud-hills, descending for about
a mile into the flat. The desert in all its dignified
grandeur, spread before us almost uninterruptedly
from due north to south-east, as far as the eye
could see. North, a long way off, one could
perceive a low range of hills extending in an
easterly direction, and beyond at 30&deg; bearings
magnetic (about N.N.E.) rose a very high
mountain and yet another very far north-east,
with some isolated conical hills of fair height
standing before it in the same direction; otherwise
everything else in front of us was as flat
and as barren as could be.</p>

<p>At Darband halting place there is an interesting
old circular tower, much battered, as if it
had seen some fighting. The attacks on it seem
to have taken place mostly from the south-westerly
side, which aspect bears evident marks
of violent assaults. The tower is most cleverly
loopholed, so as to protect the inmates while
firing on the enemy, and has a look-out house
on the top. For additional protection the entrance
door is about twenty feet above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-48" id="Pg_2-48"></a>[<a href="./images/2-48.png">48</a>]</span>
ground and can only be reached by a ladder,
which was drawn up in cases of emergency.</p>

<p>A large dilapidated and filthy caravanserai&mdash;a
regular fortress with a watch tower of its own
and loop-holes all round&mdash;is erected in the
vicinity in another commanding position. In
the gully below there is a small oasis of palm
trees and a few square yards of vegetation alongside
a small spring of brackish water&mdash;the only
water there is&mdash;with a reservoir. Next to this,
west of the caravanserai, are the remains of a few
mud huts in ruins.</p>

<p>We were here only 3,780 feet above the sea.
The heat was terrific.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-010.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-010_th.jpg" alt="Author's Camels being Fed in the Desert." title="Author's Camels being Fed in the Desert." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Author's Camels being Fed in the Desert.</p>

<p>Brackish water is not pleasant to drink, but it
is not necessarily unhealthy. Personally, I am a
great believer in the compensating laws of
Nature in preference to the ill-balanced habits of
civilised men, and am certain that the best thing
one can drink in the desert, under the abnormal
conditions of heat, dust and dryness, is salt water,
which stimulates digestion and keeps the system
clean. Of filters, condensing apparatuses, soda-water
cartridges, and other such appliances for
difficult land travelling, the less said the better.
They are very pretty toys, the glowing advertisements
of which may add to the profits of
geographical magazines, but they are really more
useful in cities in Europe than practical in the
desert. Possibly they may be a consolation to
a certain class of half-reasoning people. But anything
else, it might be argued would serve equally
well. One sees them advertised as preventatives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-49" id="Pg_2-49"></a>[<a href="./images/2-49.png">49</a>]</span>
of malarial fever, but no sensible person who has
ever had fever or seen it in others would ever
believe that it comes from drinking water.
Fever is in the atmosphere&mdash;one breathes fever;
one does not necessarily drink it. When the
water is corrupted, the air is also corrupted, and
to filter the one and not the other is an operation
the sense of which I personally cannot see.</p>

<p>It has ever been my experience, and that also of
others, that the fewer precautions one takes, the
more one relies on Nature to take care of one
instead of on impracticable devices&mdash;the better
for one's health in the end. I do not mean by
this that one should go and drink dirty water to
avoid fever,&mdash;far from it,&mdash;but if the water is dirty
the best plan is not to drink it at all, whether
filtered&mdash;or, to be accurate, passed through a filter&mdash;or
not, or made into soda-water!</p>

<p>One fact is certain, that if one goes through
a fever district one can take all the precautions
in the world, but if one's system is so inclined
one is sure to contract it; only the more the
precautions, the more violent the fever.</p>

<p>But to return to our specific case, brackish
water is not necessarily dirty, and as I have said,
is to my mind one of Nature's protections
against fever of the desert. In my own case,
when I partook of it freely, it decidedly kept the
fever down.</p>

<p>We made a much earlier start, at 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, on
November 13th, and I had to walk part of the
way as it was too steep for the camels. We had
great trouble in taking them down to the dry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-50" id="Pg_2-50"></a>[<a href="./images/2-50.png">50</a>]</span>
river-bed&mdash;which we were to follow, being quite
flat and therefore easier for the animals. We
went along between low hills, getting lower and
lower, and some two miles from the Darband
tower we emerged into the open, the river-bed
losing itself here in the desert.</p>

<p>During the night of the 13th-14th we
travelled 28 miles on the flat until we came
to more low hills, which we entered by another
river-bed, also dry. We had come in a north-north-east
direction so far, but we now turned
due east among high, flat-topped hills which
resembled a mass of ruined Persian houses of a
quadrangular shape, so strangely had they been
carved out by the corrosive action of water.
They were of solid rock, and eaten into holes
here and there, which from a distance gave
the appearance of windows and doors, and of
caves.</p>

<p>The river-bed on which we travelled was of
soft sand&mdash;very troublesome&mdash;and minute gravel
strewn here and there with large boulders fallen
from the cliffs at the sides. Cairns had been
erected in various prominent points by caravan
men, to show future travellers the way to Naiband
for Birjiand and Meshed.</p>

<p>Following this in an easterly direction we came
to a large basin, and then further on to another.
We continued in zig-zag for a short distance,
when we arrived at a place where the river-bed
makes an elbow, turning to the north. At this
spot a caravanserai was in course of construction,
built at the expense of some charitable person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-51" id="Pg_2-51"></a>[<a href="./images/2-51.png">51</a>]</span>
There was only one well of brackish water, and
very little of that, too. The workmen would
not let us partake of it. Everything, of course,
had to be brought, as nothing could be obtained
there, and the few workmen complained bitterly
of the hardships they had to endure in going on
with their work. They feared they would soon
run short even of water. They were all fever-stricken,
and two quite in a pitiable condition.
They had little food left; most of their animals
had died, and they were unable to leave.
Chel-Payeh was the name of this well (altitude
4,420 feet).</p>

<p>We were thirty-two miles from our last camp,
and reached here at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> On taking the loads
down we had a great disappointment. Sadek,
who was not accustomed to ride camels, was
suffering considerably, and in order to make himself
comfortable he had contrived a clever device
to avoid coming in immediate contact with the
wooden frame of his saddle. He had fastened
the two largest skins we had with our supply
of good water on the top of his saddle, and having
covered them over with blankets and carpets, on
them, he sat and slept through the whole night.
Alas! the weight of his body burst both skins
during the night and squeezed all the water out!</p>

<p>So here we were, with only two small skins of
fresh water left, which would have to last the
whole party several days. But we were to have
a further misfortune on the following march.</p>

<p>The heat was intense&mdash;146&deg; in the sun&mdash;not
an inch of shade in the middle of the day, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-52" id="Pg_2-52"></a>[<a href="./images/2-52.png">52</a>]</span>
the river-bed being cut into the plain, and therefore
lower than the surface of the remainder of
the desert, the lack of a current of air made this
spot quite suffocating; so much so that both
camels and men were getting quite overcome by
the heat, and we had to start off early in the
afternoon at 4 o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fortress-like</span>, vertical rocky cliffs rose to our
left and enormous boulders tumbled down to our
right. Our direction was due north. On our
right, as we were again entering the flat desert,
a quadrangular fort of natural formation stood on
the mountain-side.</p>

<p>We did not halt for dinner as we could find no
fuel to do the cooking with, and we marched all
night (November 15th)&mdash;a most painful march,
for the camels were all more or less sick and tired,
and they dragged themselves jerkily, grunting and
making the most awful noises all night.</p>

<p>My fever got very bad and I was seized with
bad pains in my ribs and spine. Sadek and the
camel men complained of feeling very ill, and
the cats remonstrated from their high perch at
not being let out of their box at the customary
hour. To add to our happiness, one of my
camels, carrying some air-tight cases with sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-54" id="Pg_2-54"></a>[<a href="./images/2-54.png">54</a>]</span>
brass corners, collided with the camel conveying
the precious load of the two remaining water-skins
which hung on its sides, and, of course, as
fate would have it, the brass corners wrenched
the skin and out flowed every drop of water,
which was avidly absorbed by the dry sand.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-011.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-011_th.jpg" alt="The Trail we left behind in the Salt Desert." title="The Trail we left behind in the Salt Desert." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Trail we left behind in the Salt Desert.</p>

<p>The character of the country was the same as
on the previous day, a long stretch of flat, then
undulations, after which we entered another dry
canal cut deep, with vertical rocky sides, very
similar to the Chel-Payeh except that in the bed
of the gorge itself there were now enormous flat
slabs of stone instead of sand and gravel, as the
day before. Further on we were surrounded
by low hills, which we crossed by a pass, and
after having been on the saddle continuously for
sixteen hours we halted at eight o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> in
the middle of a broiling, barren stretch of sand,
gravel and shingle.</p>

<p>After so long a march, and under such
unpleasant conditions, our throats and tongues
were parched with thirst. Fortunately, we still
had one skin of water left, I thought, so my first
impulse was to hasten to have it taken off the
saddle that we might all have a sip. But
misfortune pursued us. On approaching the
camel that carried it, the animal was all wet on
one side, and I fully realised what to expect.
Sadek, with a long face of dismay, took down
the flabby empty skin; the water had all
dripped out of it, and here we were, in the
middle of the desert, no well, whether salt or
otherwise, and not a thimbleful of water!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-55" id="Pg_2-55"></a>[<a href="./images/2-55.png">55</a>]</span></p>

<p>The very thought that we could get nothing
to drink made us ten times more thirsty, and we
seemed to be positively roasting under the fierce
sun. The camel men threw themselves down
upon their felt coats and moaned and groaned,
and the camels, who had drunk or eaten nothing
for three days, appeared most unhappy and
grunted pitifully.</p>

<p>For want of better remedy we sucked pebbles,
which stimulated salivation and allayed the
thirst to a certain extent, but with the high
fever, which brought about fearful exhaustion
and severe aches, and the unpleasant, abundant
electricity in the air caused by the intense
dryness&mdash;which has a most peculiar effect on
one's skin&mdash;we none of us felt particularly
happy. The three cats were the only philosophers
of the party and were quite sympathetic.
They amused themselves by climbing
up the camel's long necks, just as they would up
a tree, to the evident discomfort of the larger
animals. They had a particular fancy for sitting
on the camels' bushy heads.</p>

<p>The electricity with which the air of the
desert is absolutely saturated is gradually absorbed
by the human body and stored as in an accumulator.
On touching the barrel of a rifle or any
other good conductor of electricity, one would
discharge an electric spark of some length. By
rubbing one's woollen blankets with one's hands
one could always generate sufficient electricity
to produce a spark; and as for the cats, if one
touched them they always gave out a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-56" id="Pg_2-56"></a>[<a href="./images/2-56.png">56</a>]</span>
many sparks. At night, if one caressed them,
there was quite a luminous greenish glow under
one's fingers as they came into contact with the
hair. Quite a brilliant flash ensued when the
cats were rubbed with a woollen blanket.</p>

<p>We had only risen about 100 feet to 4,520 feet
from our last camp, and we steered N.N.E. for
the high Naiband Mountain.</p>

<p>The camel men, taking advantage of my
being ill, were very troublesome and attempted
some of their tricks; but although I was absolutely
at their mercy I screwed up what little
strength I had and brought them back to their
senses. The camels, they said, were very ill, and
we could not possibly go on. We certainly
could not stop where we were, and I most
decidedly would not go back, so, when night
came, on we went leaving camp at 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and
travelling first over a great flat stretch, then
among low hills and through several ravines cut
by water. We travelled some ten hours at a
good pace, and when nearing the Naiband
Mountain the country became quite undulating.</p>

<p>On November 16th we arrived in a small
oasis of high palm trees, with a streamlet of salt
water forming a pool or two, dirty to a degree
owing to the bad habits of camels when drinking.
Our camels, who had drunk nothing for
several days, on perceiving these pools made a
dash for them and sucked to their hearts' content
gallons of water of a ghastly reddish-green tint,
almost as thick as syrup with mud and organic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-57" id="Pg_2-57"></a>[<a href="./images/2-57.png">57</a>]</span>
matter, but which they seemed to enjoy all the
same.</p>

<p>There was here a much battered tower,
attributed, to Beluch, who are said to have
fought here most bravely in times gone by, but
more probably of Afghan origin&mdash;or at least
erected during the time of the Afghan invasion.
It is said to be some centuries old, but here
again it is well to have one's doubts upon the
matter.</p>

<p>As I was examining the tower, which has
undoubtedly seen some terrific fighting, a giant
man emerged from the palm trees and came
towards us. He was some 6 feet 6 inches in
height, and being slender, with a small head,
appeared to be even taller than he really was.
He strode disjointedly towards us and was somewhat
peculiar in manner and speech. He examined
us very closely and then ran away up to
the village&mdash;a quaint old place perched high on
the mountain side and with eight picturesque
towers. Most of these towers were round, but a
large quadrangular one stood apart on a separate
hill.</p>

<p>There were innumerable holes in the rock,
which were at one time habitations, but are used
now as stables mostly for donkeys, of which
there were a great number in the place. The
rock on which the village stood is very rugged
and difficult of access, as can be seen by the
photograph which I took, and the architecture
of the buildings had a character peculiar
to itself and differed very considerably from any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-58" id="Pg_2-58"></a>[<a href="./images/2-58.png">58</a>]</span>
other houses we had met in Persia. They
were flat-roofed, with very high walls, and
four circular apertures to answer the purpose of
windows about half-way up the wall. The
roof was plastered and made a kind of verandah,
where the natives spread fruit and vegetables to dry
and the women had their small weaving looms.
On one side of the rock, where the greater
number of habitations were to be found, they
actually appeared one on the top of the other,
the front door of one being on the level with the
roof of the underlying one.</p>

<p class="illc">Rock Habitations, Naiband.</p>

<p>The path to the village was very steep, tortuous
and narrow. The village extended from
south-west to north-east on the top of the
mountain, and the separate quadrangular tower
occupied a prominent position to its eastern
extremity. There were palm trees and fields
both to the south and east at the foot of the
rocky mountain on which the village stood, and
to the W.N.W. (300&deg; bearings magnetic) of it
towered the majestic Naiband Mountain mass,
very high, one of the great landmarks of the
Dasht-i-Lut, the Salt Desert.</p>

<p>Directly above the village of Naiband was a
peak from which, although of no great altitude&mdash;4,500
ft.&mdash;one got a beautiful bird's-eye view
both of the village and the surrounding country.
An immense stretch of desert spread below us,
uninterrupted from north-east to south except by
a small cluster of hillocks directly under us, and
by the continuation towards the south-west of
the Naiband mountainous mass; a high mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-59" id="Pg_2-59"></a>[<a href="./images/2-59.png">59</a>]</span>
lay to (170&deg; bearings magnetic) S.S.E. The
highest peak of the Naiband was to the north of
the village, and the mountainous region extended
also in a direction further north beyond the
mountain that gives its name to the whole mass.
S.S.E. (150&deg; b.m.) of the village down in the
plain rose an island of hills and also a few more
to the east.</p>

<p>The desert was rather more undulating in the
eastern portion, but absolutely flat towards the
south-west and to the south, while north-east
of the village stood a weird collection of
picturesquely confused brown-red and whitish
mountains.</p>

<p>Most of the cultivation&mdash;only a few patches&mdash;was
visible to the S.W. and E.N.E. of the village.
Palm trees were numerous. A spring of fresh
water ran down the mountain side, through the
main street of the village, and down into the
fields, in the irrigation of which it lost itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I climbed</span> up to the village, accompanied by one
of my camel men, but our friend the giant had
preceded us and given the warning that a <i>ferenghi</i>
had arrived, and we were met on the road by a
number of boys and men who were running down
the hill to see the new arrival. The people were
not particularly respectful, and freely passed remarks,
not always complimentary&mdash;in fact, most
offensive; but as I was bent on seeing all that
there was to be seen, I paid no heed and continued
to go up.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-014.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-014_th.jpg" alt="The Village of Naiband, and Rock Dwellings in the Cliff." title="The Village of Naiband, and Rock Dwellings in the Cliff." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Village of Naiband, and Rock Dwellings in the Cliff.</p>

<p>The camel man, who was getting quite alarmed&mdash;especially
when a stone or two were flung at
us&mdash;begged me to return to camp, but I would
not, and as I had my rifle with me I thought I
could hold my own, and certainly did not wish the
natives to think that an Englishman feared them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-61" id="Pg_2-61"></a>[<a href="./images/2-61.png">61</a>]</span></p>

<p>It appears that a European had visited this
spot some time previously, and they had some
grievance against him, but although it seemed
rather hard that I should come in for the punishment
which should have been meted to my predecessor,
I well knew that the only way out of
the scrape was to face the music. To run away
would have been fatal.</p>

<p>So we entered the village by a narrow path,
while men, women and children collected on the
house-tops and in the doorways and gesticulated
and spouted away as fine a collection of insults as
one may expect to listen to in one's life. The
Naiband people may certainly be congratulated
on the possession of a most extensive and complete
vocabulary of swear words.</p>

<p>Pretending unconcern, but keeping a watchful
eye on what was taking place all round, I stopped
here and there to examine the small water-skins
hanging in couples or more outside each doorway,
and halted in the small square of the village
to admire the wretched buildings all round.</p>

<p>The lower portion of the houses was of mud,
the upper of stone. Down the side of the main
street gurgled the limpid little stream. Each
house had a sort of walled recess outside the front
door, reached by a step or two, where tilling
tools rested against the wall, and where the
women's spinning wheels were worked during
the day. The wheels, however, were now idle,
for the women had joined the men in the demonstration.</p>

<p>It was most evident that <i>ferenghis</i> were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-62" id="Pg_2-62"></a>[<a href="./images/2-62.png">62</a>]</span>
popular at Naiband, but, come what might, here
I was, and here I would stay as long as it suited
me. A stone flung with considerable force hit
me in the knee&mdash;stones always have a way of
striking you in the most sensitive spots&mdash;and it
took me some minutes before I could recover
from the pain and move on; but I never let the
natives suspect what agony I was enduring, or
they would have done worse.</p>

<p>The slow march through the village up to the
highest point was decidedly not pleasant, missiles
flying pretty plentifully all round. Fortunately,
no more hit me quite as badly again. The camel
man had warned me that the population of Naiband
was a mixture of robbers and cut-throats,
and the facts fully proved his words, so I was
rather glad that I had taken not only my rifle
with me but a pocketful of cartridges as well.</p>

<p>Things were getting rather hot, and it was
only when, having reached a high point of vantage,
I stopped and, in full view of the crowd,
inserted a five cartridge clip in the magazine of
my Mannlicher, that most anxious inquiries were
made from the camel man as to what I was about
to do. The camel man, amid a sudden silence
and eager attention, explained the terrific powers
of a <i>ferenghi's</i> rifle which, he said, never misses
and ever kills, even ten miles off; and to add
more humour to his words he explained that
shots could be fired so quick that one had not
time to count them.</p>

<p>At this point of the lecture I casually produced
a handful of cartridges from my coat pocket, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-63" id="Pg_2-63"></a>[<a href="./images/2-63.png">63</a>]</span>
having counted them aloud, proceeded to count
the people, who watched, somewhat flabbergasted.
The device answered perfectly. They dropped
the stones which, during the short armistice, they
had carefully nursed in their hands, and some
thought they had better return to their homes,
the bolder ones only remaining, who put a grin
of friendship on their faces, and made signs that
they would try to do no further harm.</p>

<p>Peace being proclaimed, and after making them
pay their salaams, which seemed the most unusual
thing they ever had to do in their lifetime, I spoke
to them in a friendly way and patted them on
the back. They were much impressed with the
rifle and wanted me to let them see it in their
own hands, which, of course, I did not do.
They showed me some of their houses, which
were very dirty&mdash;people, fowls, and in some
cases a donkey or a goat, occupying the same
room.</p>

<p>These brigand villagers were most interesting
as a type. They were quite unlike the Persians
of the West, and they certainly had nothing
in common with the Afghan; nor did they resemble
the people of the northern part of Persia.
The Beluch type came nearer. It would be
curious to trace exactly where they came from&mdash;although
undoubtedly their features must have
been greatly modified, even altogether altered, by
the climatic conditions of the spot they live in.</p>

<p>One was struck by the abnormal length, thinness
and disjointedness of their limbs, and by the
long, well-chiselled faces, with handsome aquiline<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-64" id="Pg_2-64"></a>[<a href="./images/2-64.png">64</a>]</span>
noses, broad and high foreheads, well-defined
eyebrows in a straight line across the brow,
piercing eyes well protected by the brow and
drooping at the outer corners, with quite a hollow
under the lower eyelid; very firm mouths full of
expression and power, also drooping slightly at
the corners, and high cheek bones.</p>

<p>Their appearance was certainly most picturesque,
and they possessed the cat-like manner and
general ways of feline animals which made them
appear rather unreliable but in a way quite attractive.
They were evidently people accustomed
to high-handed ways, and they needed very careful
handling. They were frank and resolute enough
in their speech&mdash;ever talking at the top of their
voices, which, however, sounded quite musical
and not grating.</p>

<p>They possessed dirty but very beautifully-formed
hands and feet, the thumb only being somewhat
short and stumpy, but the fingers supple,
long and tapering. The few lines which they
possessed in the palms of their hands were very
strongly marked. There was a good deal of
refinement about their facial features and hands
which made me think that these people came
from a good stock, and even the ears&mdash;which
were generally malformed with all the natives of
Persia which had so far come under my observation&mdash;were
in this case much more delicately
modelled and infinitely better shaped. The chins
were beautifully chiselled, even when somewhat
slanting backwards.</p>

<p>I give here a photograph which I took of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-65" id="Pg_2-65"></a>[<a href="./images/2-65.png">65</a>]</span>
typical young men, and which I think bears out
my remarks.</p>

<p>There was an extraordinary family resemblance
in nearly all the heads one saw, which made
one suspect constant intermarriage among relations
in the small community. In fact, on
asking, they professed to be all related to one
another.</p>

<p>Another very curious point about the faces of
the male members of Naiband village, which
contrasted with other natives of Persia, was that,
whereas the latter can grow heavy beards from a
comparatively very tender age, the Naiband young
men were quite hairless on the face, almost like
Mongolians&mdash;even at twenty or twenty-two years
of age. When they had reached a fairly advanced
age, however, some forty years, they seemed to
grow quite a good black beard and heavy moustache,
somewhat curly, never very long, and of a
finer texture than with modern Persians. The
hair of the skull was perfectly straight, and was
worn long, parted in the middle, with an occasional
fringe on the forehead.</p>

<p>Nature's freaks are many and varied. While
the men had invariably long aquiline noses,
elongated faces, and eyes well protected by the
brow, the children, until the age of ten or
twelve, had rather stumpy faces with noses
actually turned up, and most beautiful large eyes
softened by abnormally long eyelashes, the eyes
themselves, strangely enough, being quite <i>&agrave; fleur
de t&ecirc;te</i>. I noticed this curious phenomenon in
members of the same family, and the older ones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-66" id="Pg_2-66"></a>[<a href="./images/2-66.png">66</a>]</span>
told me that when they were young their faces
were also stubby and their noses turned up.</p>

<p>The inference I drew was that it must be the
climatic conditions of the desert that have the
elongating effect, not only upon the facial
features, but on all the limbs of the people.
The people were not naturally born elongated.
The climate certainly has an elongating effect on
plants, or leaves, which all tend to come to a
point, such as the leaves of the elongated palm
trees, for instance, or any of the other spiky
plants one finds in parts of the desert.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of the demon about
the women of the place, a superabundance of
fire in their movements and in the expression of
their flashing eyes, which was a great contrast to
the slow, dignified manner of the men, when
seen under normal circumstances. Their frame
was much more powerfully built than that of the
men. The ladies seemed to be in a perpetual
state of anger. That they were industrious there
could be no mistake, and one could but be
amazed at their muscular strength in lifting
heavy loads; but, taking things all round, one
was rather glad to have no friends among the
Naiband fair sex when one saw how their men,
relations or otherwise, were pulled about by
them. The men positively feared them, and the
women seemed to have it all their own way.</p>

<p>They were so violent that it was most difficult
to approach them, but with some careful coaxing
I succeeded in persuading the wildest and most
typical of the lot to sit for her photograph,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-67" id="Pg_2-67"></a>[<a href="./images/2-67.png">67</a>]</span>
which I look upon as quite an achievement,
considering that it might have cost her life or
mine or both. As it was it went pretty well,
and when I gave her a few silver pieces, she
screamed with delight and sounded them on a
stone to make sure they were good.</p>

<p>Women blackened their eyes underneath artificially,
which gave them a languid but ardent
appearance. Their long, wild, curly hair hung
loose at the side of the head, over which they
wore a kerchief fastened into a knot under the
chin. Their costume was simple, a mere short
blue cotton skirt reaching below the knee,
and a little red loose shirt with ample sleeves.
Various silver ornaments and charms, mainly
old coins, hung round their necks from leather
cords.</p>

<p>The arms and legs, quite bare, were well-shaped
in most cases, and showed abnormal
muscular development, due, no doubt, to the
hard work the women were made to endure.
They were positively used as beasts of burden&mdash;which
occupation they seemed to like&mdash;while
the men, I presume, lazily sat about smoking
their tobacco or opium. But the body&mdash;very
likely owing to the same reason&mdash;is, from a
European point of view, quite shapeless, even
in comparatively young women hardly above
twenty. Their little blouses, generally torn or
carelessly left open, display repulsively pendent
breasts and overlapping waists, while the abdominal
region, draped by a thin skirt, appeared
much deformed by undue development.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-68" id="Pg_2-68"></a>[<a href="./images/2-68.png">68</a>]</span></p>

<p>These facts are given as they were typical of
the majority of women in the place. The diet
and the strain of lifting and carrying huge
weights on the head may, to a certain extent,
account for these evils. I also saw one or two
cases of varicose veins.</p>

<p>The children seemed very pale and anaemic,
a condition which has been mainly brought
about, I think, by the constant intermarriage
among relations.</p>

<p>Men, women and children possessed admirable
teeth, of a slightly yellowish tint, very thick,
powerful and regular enough, although the
front teeth were rather too long, especially in
adults. They were, however, generally well
protected and covered by the lips, almost
invariably tightly closed.</p>

<p>The people, I noticed, had a tendency to
breathe mostly through the nose. Their nostrils
were wide, well-cut and healthy looking. They all
possessed very keen eyesight, but not good hearing.</p>

<p>The want of expansion of the men's chests
was a striking feature of masculine anatomy at
Naiband, and, in fact, the profile silhouette of
members of the Naiband strong sex was not
unlike that of a phonograph trumpet resting on
the ground, for they wore trousers of enormous
size, divided skirts of the largest pattern, pure and
simple, and little jackets over them with broad
sleeves and buttoned over on the right shoulder.
It seemed almost that the further we got into
the desert the larger the trousers of the men in
the oases. Some of the men had several yards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-69" id="Pg_2-69"></a>[<a href="./images/2-69.png">69</a>]</span>
of material draped round their legs, in Hindoo
fashion, instead of trousers.</p>

<p>The colours of their clothes were white and
dark blue, while their headgear consisted of a
double skull cap, a thin, coloured one underneath
and a light brown, thick felt one over it.
The men were either barefooted or wore sandals.</p>

<p>Things went fairly well while we remained
talking in the village, but in the meantime the
entire population had turned out, and for some
reason of their own again became rather boisterous.
Having seen all there was to be seen I
made my way down to camp as slowly as
possible, followed by a howling mob. The
moment one had one's back turned stones flew
in abundance. The camel man and I went
down the steep incline, and when we reached
the last houses of the village a great number of
people were congregated on the roofs, who
gesticulated frantically and yelled something or
other at me as I passed. One or two of them
had long matchlocks. We had gone but a few
yards when a shot was fired at us, and a minute
or so later another, but no damage was inflicted.</p>

<p>We went on with assumed calm and stopped,
apparently to look at the scenery all round, but
really to watch what the howling mob behind
were doing, and eventually, when we reached
the foot of the mountain and were out in the
open instead of among rocks, the mob, taken by
panic, bolted, and we saw them scrambling with
great speed up the rocky path to the village like
so many rabbits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> misfortunes befel us at this place. We
had made our camp in the oasis of palm trees at
the foot of the mountain, and as the camels were
much worn out we were unable to proceed on
our journey the same evening. The heat during
the night under the palm trees was quite
suffocating, and I had to remove my bedding
into the open where one could breathe a little
better.</p>

<p>The camel men feared that during the night
we might be attacked by the villagers and we
made ready for any emergency, but nobody
came.</p>

<p>There was so much electricity in the air that
it gave quite an unpleasant feeling, and had a
curious effect upon one's skin. The cats on
coming in contact with the woollen blankets
discharged sparks all over, and sparks also
snapped from one's fingers on touching anything
that was a good conductor of electricity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-71" id="Pg_2-71"></a>[<a href="./images/2-71.png">71</a>]</span></p>

<p>A wild animal came into our camp during the
night and carried away some newly-purchased
hens. We had been told that there were many
wolves and foxes in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In the morning we were confronted with
what seemed a disaster. Eleven camels of our
combined caravans had disappeared. Had they
been stolen or had they run away? The camel
men were in tears, and, instead of going to look
for them, sat on the loads sobbing bitterly and
wiping the tears from their eyes with the skirts
of their long coats. A ray of hope arose when
we discovered their tracks. They had made for
some hot water springs, some miles to the east,
and judging from their footprints were evidently
travelling at a great pace. Two men on other
camels were despatched after them, and we had to
resign ourselves to a delay of another day.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, there was a sudden change
in the temperature, and the thermometer in
the sun only registered 105&deg;, which made us
feel quite chilly after the 140&deg; and 150&deg; of
previous days. Our camp was at an altitude
of 3,810 ft. (at the foot of the Naiband
Mountain).</p>

<p>Sadek took the opportunity of the delay to
set everything tidy, and we had a great washing
day. He sent for a barber in the village to trim
his hair and beard. The Naiband Figaro was an
extraordinary creature, a most bare-faced rascal,
who had plenty to say for himself, and whose
peculiar ways and roaming eyes made us conceal
away out of his sight all small articles, for fear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-72" id="Pg_2-72"></a>[<a href="./images/2-72.png">72</a>]</span>
that he should walk away with them. He
carried all the tools of his trade around his
waist in a belt, and ground his razor first on a
stone which he licked with his tongue, then
using his bare arms and legs for stropping
purposes, as snapshotted in the accompanying
photograph.</p>

<p>The camel men&mdash;on whom he was first
requested to experiment&mdash;he shaved, splashing
their faces with salt water during the process,
but Sadek, the next victim, produced a cake of
soap with which he luxuriously lathered his own
face, and which the barber scraped gradually
from the chin and cheeks and every now and
then deposited the razor's wipings on his patient's
head.</p>

<p>We were able to buy some fresh water skins,
and this time they were really water tight. The
natives, naturally, took every advantage of us in
the bargains, but we were able to purchase a lot
of fresh provisions, which we needed badly, and
men and beasts felt none the worse for our
compulsory halt.</p>

<p>In the middle of the second night we were
waked up by some distant grunts, and the camel
men jumped up in great glee as they had
recognised the beloved voices of some of their
strayed camels. A few minutes later, in fact, the
whole eleven were brought back by the two
men who had gone in search of them. They
had found them some twenty miles off.</p>

<p>From Lawah to Naiband we had come
practically due north, but from this camp to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-73" id="Pg_2-73"></a>[<a href="./images/2-73.png">73</a>]</span>
Birjand the way lay due east for the first portion
of the journey. At 160&deg; b.m. (S.S.E.) in the
desert rose a high mountain.</p>

<p>We had everything ready for our departure,
but the camel men were in a dreadful state as
some villager had told them that the news had
spread that the strong boxes which the <i>ferenghi</i>
had were full of silver and gold&mdash;as a matter of
fact there was hardly any left of either&mdash;and that
a raid was being arranged for that night to kill
us and rob our baggage when we were starting.
The camel men spent the whole day polishing up
the old rifles they possessed and, much to my
concern for their safety, loaded them.</p>

<p>To allay their fears we made a sudden start at
5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> instead of at the hour of 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> which
had been previously arranged.</p>

<p>One mile beyond Naiband a track branches to
the north-east for Meshed, and here we bade
good-bye to a Persian husband and wife&mdash;he aged
twenty-eight, she aged twelve&mdash;who in the company
of a donkey, were on a pilgrimage from Yezd
to the Sacred Shrine. We had picked them up in a
sorry plight in the desert, the husband riding the
lame donkey, the girl on foot and shoving both
from behind. I could not help admiring their
enterprise. All the provisions they had carried
were a few cucumbers, figs, and a load of bread,
nearly all of which were exhausted when we
found them. On remonstrating with the
strapping youth for riding the donkey while he
made his poor wife walk, he replied that they
had been newly married and it would not do for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-74" id="Pg_2-74"></a>[<a href="./images/2-74.png">74</a>]</span>
a man to show consideration for a wife so
soon!</p>

<p>She, being a city girl, was a bundle of clothing
and we could not see her face, but she
seemed a nice meek little thing, with pretty
hands and feet. On being asked whether she
was tired, a thread of voice from under her
<i>chudder</i> said she was, and on being invited to
ride one of my camels on the top of a load, there
was a giggle which meant "yes."</p>

<p>The selected camel was brought down on his
knees, and Sadek and Ali Murat hauled her up
in the most approved style; she having an
evident joke at her selfish husband for having a
better mount than he after all. Unfortunately,
the poor child was so exhausted that after she
had gone some distance, with the swaying of the
camel she became fast asleep, lost her balance
and fell on her head. Nobody delighted in the
misfortune more than her lord and master, who
did not fail to impress upon her that this was
evidently Allah's punishment for her vanity in
trying to be superior to her better half! Rubbing
her aching skull, and much concerned at
the <i>chudder</i> having got torn, the bride thought
she had better resign herself to walk after all.</p>

<p>Here, too, as in other parts of the desert, near
mountainous regions we found the usual deep, cut
channels carrying into the desert the overflow of
rain water from the Naiband Mountain, and the
many little hills at its foot; otherwise in the
thirty-six miles which we covered during the
night there was absolutely nothing of interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-75" id="Pg_2-75"></a>[<a href="./images/2-75.png">75</a>]</span></p>

<p>When we had gone some ten miles from Naiband
the camel men, tired of carrying their
matchlocks, slung them to the saddles and professed
the danger of an attack over. We were
in the open again. I was much troubled by
my fever, which had seized me violently and
brought on aches all over my body.</p>

<p>We camped at 3,480 feet, having descended
330 feet in thirty-six miles, an almost perfectly
flat stretch except a hillock or undulation here
and there. My fever continued so fierce the
whole day that I had not the strength to stand
up nor the inclination to eat, the exhaustion
caused by the very high temperature being indescribable.</p>

<p>We left at 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, meaning to make another
long march. The night was intensely cold, with
a terrific wind sweeping from the north-east.
Several times during the night, when we came
across a tamarisk shrub or two, we halted for a
few minutes to make a bonfire and warm our
frozen hands and toes. We actually came across
a stream of brackish water&mdash;four feet broad, and
about two to three inches deep&mdash;the largest
stream we had seen since entering the desert, and
having been twelve hours on the saddle to cover
only twenty-four miles, camels and men shivering
pitifully from the cold, and the latter also from
fever, we made camp in a spot where there was
an abundance of tamarisks and a deep well, the
water of which was fully twenty feet below the
earth's surface.</p>

<p>A small basin had been excavated next to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-76" id="Pg_2-76"></a>[<a href="./images/2-76.png">76</a>]</span>
well. We filled it with water by means of a
bucket, and it was a real pleasure to see the
camels crowding round it and satisfying their
thirst of two days. We did not allow them to
drink the water of the brackish stream.</p>

<p>The elevation of this camp was 3,890 feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left camp at 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on the night of
November 20th-21st, and by midnight the cold
grew intense. The camel men lighted big bonfires
all through the night wherever they found
a few shrubs, but I was so ill with fever that I
had not the strength and energy to dismount
from my camel, on which I was shivering with
cold although well wrapped up in blankets.</p>

<p>After marching eight miles from our last
camp we came to a brackish well where the
camel men replenished their water-skins. I was
rather interested to see what dulled sense of taste
these men of the desert possessed. When I saw
them making a rush for this well I thought that
probably we had come to fresh water, and on
asking them they said this was a well of excellent
"sweet water." When I tasted it, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-78" id="Pg_2-78"></a>[<a href="./images/2-78.png">78</a>]</span>
so salt that it quite made one's inflamed gums
and palate smart with pain. I noticed some
days later that when we did actually get fairly
sweet water they could detect no difference
between it and the most brackish water.</p>

<p>We had come through hilly and broken
country, over low passes and narrow gorges
flanking dry river-beds. Then we had entered
another immense flat stretch of <i>lut</i>, quite level
except an occasional solitary hillock breaking
the monotonous line of the horizon here and
there. From one of these hillocks (4,300 feet)
near our camp of November 21st one got quite
an interesting panorama all round.</p>

<p>The highest mountain in sight was still the
Naiband peak to the south-west of us. A range
which seemed about 50 <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'miles miles'">miles</ins> off spread to
the north-west, and before it&mdash;about 20 miles
distant from us&mdash;a very long low hill range.
In an arc from our west to our north were distinguishable
several high pointed peaks. A
blackish brown, handsomely cut hill stood
prominent a mile or so from us in the middle
of the plain.</p>

<p>To the north the country was much broken
up and low. There was a stream of salt water
running from east to west with thick salt deposits
on each side of the water edge. To the north-east
the hills showed no peculiar characteristics
but to the east and south-east could be observed
two short hill-ranges, much indented, of broken
up and corroded rock, similar to the many we
had already found across the desert. To the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-79" id="Pg_2-79"></a>[<a href="./images/2-79.png">79</a>]</span>
north and to the south of the hill range which
stood to the east of us there were low passes, and
behind them again the flat <i>lut</i>.</p>

<p>The only thing of real interest in the
absolutely bare parts of the desert is the geological
formation of the soil and the only
amusement is to examine the different beautifully
coloured stones that can be picked up, such
as handsome agates, bits of malachite, crystals,
beautiful marbles, and flints. These are all the
more interesting when one thinks that most of
them may have travelled hundreds, some, thousands
of miles to get there, either brought by
the water when the country was submerged or
shifted on and on by the wind. They all bear
marks of travel, and even the hardest are
polished smooth, the original natural angles of
crystals being in many cases actually worn down
and quite rounded. Sand-polished pebbles of
red jasper, jasper-conglomerates, chalcedony,
quartz and agatescent quartz, pink and brown
corroded limestone, and calcite were the most
frequently met with.</p>

<p>A desert is, in England, always associated
with glorious sunsets. Why this should be so
is rather difficult to be understood by anybody
reasoning in the right way, because the magnificent
tints of a sunset are caused by moisture in
the air and not by abnormal dryness. All the
time that I was in the desert itself I never saw a
sunset that really had half the picturesqueness of
one of our most modest sunsets in Europe. The
sun disappeared very fast, leaving a slightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-80" id="Pg_2-80"></a>[<a href="./images/2-80.png">80</a>]</span>
yellow glow above the horizon, which soon
became greenish by blending with the blue sky
and then black with night. The twilight was
extremely short.</p>

<p>We seldom saw clouds at all in the desert and
when we did they were scrubby, little, patchy,
angular lumps at enormous heights above the
earth's surface. They were generally white or
light grey. Occasionally they were of the fish-bone
pattern, in long successive ridges, resembling
the waves formed on the sand surface
when shifted by wind. Soon after the sun had
disappeared behind the horizon, these clouds
generally changed their colour from white into
black and made long lines stretching for great
distances across the sky, but adding no beauty
to it.</p>

<p>Naturally, the play of shifting lights and
shadows upon the desert when the sun shone
above the clouds was quite weird, especially
when the last formation of clouds referred to
cast long bluish shadows slowly moving upon
the brilliantly-lighted, whitish tint of the ground.
Lower upon the horizon line a curtain of a dirty
brownish tint was generally to be seen, due to
particles of sand in the air, otherwise in almost
all cases that came under my observation the
clouds formed well-defined, thin, clean, horizontal
lines, or else when very high up patchy
small skiffs.</p>

<p>One missed greatly the fat, rolling, globular
clouds which are so common to Europe, and
which fill the sky with fantastic forms. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-81" id="Pg_2-81"></a>[<a href="./images/2-81.png">81</a>]</span>
is such a thing as getting tired of an everlasting
spread of blue sky and the glow of a roasting sun.</p>

<p>A strong westerly gale swept low over the
surface of the desert. It was very cold after
sunset, but fortunately we had plenty of tamarisk
shrubs at hand and camel dung with which to
make big fires.</p>

<p>The river bed below our camp was very wide,
but the salt stream itself not more than three to
four feet across. It eventually lost itself to the
north-west in the desert. The camels had been
let loose to graze and had a good feed of tamarisk,
which they seemed to enjoy much after their
long diet on reduced rations of straw and cotton
seeds.</p>

<p>We left this camp (4,120 feet) soon after
dinner at 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and during the night passed
several ranges of hills, we travelling all the time
on the flat. In the middle of the night the cold
was bitter, so cold that I had icicles hanging on
my moustache and eyelashes. It was impossible
to remain on the camels, and ill as we all felt we
had to walk&mdash;drag ourselves would be a more
suitable expression&mdash;to keep ourselves from
freezing. On these cold nights we simply
longed for the sun to come out. The dark
hours seemed interminable. One began slightly
to revive when the first glimmering of yellowish
light began to tinge the dark blue sky, and the
dazzling stars gradually lost their brilliancy and
eventually disappeared altogether from the heaven
above us.</p>

<p>On the first ray of sun appearing the devout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-82" id="Pg_2-82"></a>[<a href="./images/2-82.png">82</a>]</span>
camel men stopped the caravan, spread a small
cloth upon the ground, and, having picked up a
small stone, placed it in front of them. They
duly turned towards sacred Mecca and lifted their
arms, then, muttering their prayers, knelt and
placed their heads upon the ground, as we have
already seen others do, in the usual Mussulman
manner. They were most diligent in this
respect, and one could not help admiring the
intent fervour of their appeals to Allah. At
sunset, too, their prayers never failed to be recited&mdash;no
matter what they were busy doing at the
time, all being interrupted for the purpose.</p>

<p>At 5.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we arrived at a village called
Fedeshk&mdash;quite a large place, situated in a flat
oblong plain ten miles long and a mile and a half
wide, surrounded by low hills on all sides.</p>

<p>On being asked why he had made the camels
go so fast on this march, Ali Murat, my camel
man, blushingly confessed that in this village was
his home and his wife, whom he had not seen
for eight months. The anxiety to see his better
half, who lived only a stone-throw from where
we made camp, did not, however, prevent him
looking carefully after his camels, whom he
placed first of all in his affection, and smoking
Sadek's cigarettes, and a pipe with the other
camel men, and waiting till my tea had been
brewed to receive his customary six cups. After
all this had been gone through, which took the
best part of two hours, he disappeared and we
did not see him again for the remainder of the
morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-83" id="Pg_2-83"></a>[<a href="./images/2-83.png">83</a>]</span></p>

<p>The people of Fedeshk were striking for two
reasons, first for being sadly fever-stricken,
secondly because they were addicted to opium
smoking to a <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'diastrous'">disastrous</ins> degree. There were a
number of opium dens in the place, and I went
to see them. They were dreadful places, in
which one would suspect opium smoking was
not the only vice indulged in by the natives.</p>

<p>As I entered one of these houses, after a
considerable knocking at the door and a great
rustling of people running about the small courtyard
inside, we were admitted into a room so
dark that I at first could discern nothing at all.
The pungent, sickening odour of the opium pipes
gave one quite a turn, and I lighted up a match
to see where I was.</p>

<p>There were men lying about on mats in a
semi-stupefied state, and men attendants refilling
the pipes&mdash;similar to those used in China, a cane
holder with earthenware pipe in which tiny pills
of opium were inserted and consumed over the
flame of a small lamp. Several of the men were
in such a torpid state that they mechanically
inhaled the opium smoke when the pipes were
pressed to their lips, but were hardly cognizant
of what went about around them. The opium-den
keeper in the meantime did a roaring business,
and had a little scale on which he weighed
the opium that he served out.</p>

<p>It seemed evident, as I lighted match after
match, by certain articles of ladies' attire which
in the hurried departure had been left behind in
the room, that the usual attendants of the smokers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-84" id="Pg_2-84"></a>[<a href="./images/2-84.png">84</a>]</span>
were women, but they had stampeded away on
our arrival. One heard them chuckle in the
adjoining rooms, and in their haste, they had
left behind a great many pairs of slippers at the
entrance of the room.</p>

<p>I had two men conveyed out into the sun
where I wanted to examine them. The pupils
of their eyes had contracted to a most abnormal
extent, even before they were exposed to the
sunlight, and seemed to have almost lost the
power of expanding and contracting in various
lights, and although the eyes were wide opened
and staring they did not seem to discern what
was placed before them. The eye-ball had a
yellowish tinge and the iris was not well-defined
but seemed to have undergone discoloration
and faded away into the white of the eye.
They seemed affected by a kind of temporary
atrophy.</p>

<p>The pulse beat extremely slow and faintly;
the lips were drawn tight; the hearing so dulled
that even loud noises seemed to have no effect
upon them. The body was flabby and almost
lifeless. It was not possible to obtain an answer
to anything one asked them. They had quite a
cadaverous appearance, with yellowish, pallid
skins, sunken eyes, and teeth showing fully under
the drawn lips.</p>

<p>Only now and then, as one watched them, a
sigh, followed by a shiver or a grunt, came forth
to show us that they were still alive. The
fingers and toes displayed some muscular contraction,
but not the other joints, which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-85" id="Pg_2-85"></a>[<a href="./images/2-85.png">85</a>]</span>
quite loose. The heart beat so feebly that one
could hardly feel it.</p>

<p>They remained spread out in the yard in the
positions we had placed them, and were indeed
most pitiful objects. The den-keeper told me
that these two men were most inveterate smokers,
and were at it the whole time until they became
quite unconscious.</p>

<p>There were other men in a slightly better condition,
but all more or less showing the same
symptoms of stupefaction. Those that could
mutter words said that it was an irresistible
passion that they could never stop. The opium
gave them no dreams, they told me, but a
delicious feeling of absolute contentment and
happiness, which they could never experience
when not indulging in this disastrous vice.</p>

<p>On looking upon things impartially, however,
one came to the conclusion that, bad as it was,
opium-smoking had certainly more peaceful and
less disgusting effects upon those unfortunates
addicted to it than whiskey or absinthe, or votka
drunkenness, for instance.</p>

<p>The entire population of this village was,
unfortunately, given to this bad habit, and it was
quite pitiable to look upon their haggard, staring
faces, and idiotic expression.</p>

<p>Malarial fever is very prevalent at Fedeshk,
and some of the corpse-like people affected by it
came to my camp for medicine. They were not
unlike walking skeletons, with stringy hands and
feet and a skin of ghastly yellow colour. They
had parched, bloodless ears, curled forward, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-86" id="Pg_2-86"></a>[<a href="./images/2-86.png">86</a>]</span>
sunken cheeks, with deep sunk-in eyes. In the
more virulent cases fever was accompanied by
rheumatic pains so strong as practically to
paralyse the legs and arms, which were reduced
to a positive minimum of flesh.</p>

<p>The dwellings of Fedeshk were not impressive.
Mud hovels as usual, with domes over the
rooms, as everywhere in Persia, only the familiar
aperture, instead of being directly in the centre
of the dome itself, had a kind of hood over it to
screen it from the terrific winds of the West.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed in connection with these
winds that to the west of Fedeshk there
are rather high mountains, and even winds
originally not coming from the west may be
turned back or switched in that direction by this
chain of mountains.</p>

<p>A large ice store-house is met with at the end
of the village, which testifies to the intense cold
that can be experienced here in the winter
months.</p>

<p>An official residing in the place sent word
that he would call upon me, and we made a
grand display of all the carpets we possessed to
receive him. He arrived with a number of
servants, and we had a very pleasant interview,
with great consumption of tea. He was extremely
civil; inquired whether he could be of
any assistance, which was politely declined, and
showed intense interest in my firearms and scientific
instruments. He and his people were amazed
when I told them that their village stood at an
elevation of 4,620 ft. above sea level, and explained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-87" id="Pg_2-87"></a>[<a href="./images/2-87.png">87</a>]</span>
to them how I had measured the height by means
of aneroids and the hypsometrical apparatus.</p>

<p>"These are wonderful!" he said, with a
salaam, as he handed me back the instruments
which had been eagerly examined by all present.
"And," he added, "can you also measure the
length of cloth with them?"</p>

<p>A compass, too, he had never set eyes upon;
and he at first thought that it was constructed to
point towards Mecca! Had not one long ago
got accustomed to similar questions often asked
one by London people, the innocence of the
Persian official might have taken one's breath
away, but this was nothing to what happened
later.</p>

<p>The Persians showed great curiosity to learn
everything in connection with whatever foreign
articles I possessed and the respective prices I had
paid for them. Then Sadek was closely examined
as to the amount of food I ate every day, the
salary I paid him, and why I had come across
the desert. Was I a Russian or an Englishman?
The officer had never seen either, but heard both
well spoken of. He had understood that all
Englishmen had yellow hair; why had I dark
hair? London, he, like most Persians, believed to
be a suburb of Bombay, connected with Russia
by means of a "machine road,"&mdash;a railway!</p>

<p>Why on earth did the <i>ferenghi</i> want to know
how high mountains were? Did the <i>ferenghi</i>
know how to find gold in the earth? and so on,
were the queries which Sadek had to answer.</p>

<p>With repeated salaams, preceded by a thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-88" id="Pg_2-88"></a>[<a href="./images/2-88.png">88</a>]</span>
other questions, the official departed; but Sadek,
who was much excited, was still bent on a highly
scientific conversation to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sahib," he said, "you have travelled in many
countries, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sahib, have you been to the country where
the sun 'goes to sleep' in a hole in the earth
every evening?"</p>

<p>That was Sadek's idea of a sunset! His idea
of a sunrise was that a brand-new sun was sent
up every day, and this explained how it was that
it rose from the opposite side to that on which
it had "gone to sleep."</p>

<p>Ali Murat, looking somewhat washed out and
absent minded, came back to camp at noon,
garbed in a very handsome new coat which his
wife had woven and embroidered for him during
his absence. He was very proud of it.</p>

<p>We left Fedeshk an hour later, as I was very
anxious to reach the city of Birjand the same day
if possible. We were now again in fairly inhabited
country, and on our hurried march passed
a great many villages, large and small, such as
Shahzileh, Mazumabad, Tagot, Siaguih, Shamzabad.
Further, at Ossenabad, is to be seen a
ruined country-house of the Governor of Birjand,
then the last two villages of Khelatekhan and
Khelatehajih.</p>

<p>Ali Murat seemed rather dazzled on this last
march, and was so worn out that he threw
himself down upon the ground several times,
regardless of spoiling his smart new coat. In a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-89" id="Pg_2-89"></a>[<a href="./images/2-89.png">89</a>]</span>
moment he became fast asleep, and it took
some rousing to make him get up again. His
wife had given him a bag of <i>keshk</i>&mdash;a kind
of cheese, which looked like hardened curdled
milk&mdash;and of this he partook freely to try and
regain his former strength. Keshk cheese was
very hard stuff to eat and took a lot of chewing.
To prevent it getting too hard it had to be
soaked in water every few days.</p>

<p>We had a nasty wind against us, but the way
was flat and good; our direction, due east across
the long narrow valley of sand, nowhere broader
than a couple of miles. To the north were a
number of low hills shaped like so many tents,
white, grey, and light-red in colour, and also to
the south, where there was an additional irregular
and somewhat higher rocky mountain.</p>

<p>In the evening of November 24th we had
crossed the entire Salt Desert and arrived at the
large city of Birjand, after Meshed the most
important city of Khorassan, the journey having
occupied twenty days, which was considered a
very fast crossing.</p>

<p>There was a beautiful new caravanserai here,
with clean spacious rooms, and with a most
attentive and obliging keeper in charge of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Birjand, my camels being utterly exhausted,
I disbanded my caravan, paid up Ali Murat, and
attempted to make up a fresh caravan to proceed
to Sistan. This would take two or three days at
least, so I employed my time at first by seeing all
that there was to be seen in the place, then by
receiving various official callers, and last in trying
to shake off the fever, which I partially did by
very violent but effective methods.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-021.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-021_th.jpg" alt="The City of Birjand, showing main street and river bed combined." title="The City of Birjand, showing main street and river bed combined." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"> <span class="smcap">The City of Birjand</span>, showing main street and river bed combined.</p>

<p>We entered Birjand from the west by a wide,
dry river bed which formed the main street of
the city. A ruined fortress which seemed at one
time to have been of great strength, was to be
seen on the western extremity of the town on a
low hillock. The interior was quite interesting,
with several tiers showing how the walls had
been manned for defensive purposes.</p>

<p>The general view of Birjand reproduced in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-91" id="Pg_2-91"></a>[<a href="./images/2-91.png">91</a>]</span>
the illustration was taken from the fort and gives
a better idea of the place than any description.
It can be seen that the city is unequally divided
by the combined river-bed and main street, the
northern portion (to the left of observer in the
photograph) having merely an extensive graveyard,
a few houses, the large caravanserai at which I had
halted, and a row of shops; whereas, on the
southern side was the bulk of the houses, two,
three and some even four storied, all of a
monotonous greyish colour, the buildings being
mostly of sun-dried mud bricks. The little
windows in sets of threes and fives, with brown
wooden shutters, relieved to a certain extent the
dulness of the architecture, while a certain relief
to the eye was afforded by a dome and another
building, both painted white, in marked contrast
to the mud walls. Many houses had long
verandahs and balconies, on which the women
spread their washing.</p>

<p>As the city was built in terraces upon undulating
ground and two higher hills, it covered
a greater area than it at first appeared to do.
The streets were very tortuous and narrow, arched
over in some places, forming long dark tunnels,
many of the dwellings having rooms over them
directly above the roadway.</p>

<p>Making a rough guess, there were, I daresay,
some 3,500 to 4,000 houses in Birjand and its
suburbs, with a population of not over 30,000
souls. These figures, the natives said, were about
correct, but no exact statistics existed.</p>

<p>The higher point of Birjand was at its south-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-92" id="Pg_2-92"></a>[<a href="./images/2-92.png">92</a>]</span>east
portion, and at the most extreme south-east
point of the town at the bottom of the hill was
the high, square, fortress-like enclosure with
bastions and a high tower, as represented in the
illustration. It was in a dilapidated condition,
but was, nevertheless, the only structure in
Birjand which had a claim to some picturesqueness.
It was the old citadel, inhabited at one
time by the Amir. The wall of the citadel
facing south had a large window with <i>musharabeah</i>
woodwork, and a lower building to the
side. The adjacent building also had quaint
balconies.</p>

<p>A good view of the whole city was obtained
from a high, isolated building to the south of
the town, in the centre of a large but somewhat
untidy fruit garden, an official residence, but
now very little used except in cases of emergency
to accommodate passing officials or distinguished
people.</p>

<p>There were some Persian military officers
staying there and they most kindly showed me
all that there was to be seen, after having
entertained me to some refreshments. They
conveyed me inside the citadel where they
proudly showed me a battery of six nine-pounder
guns of obsolete Austrian manufacture; an
eighteen pounder bronze gun and another gun
of a somewhat smaller calibre, both of Persian
make. They were very carelessly kept, there
being apparently only a ragged boy or two to
look after them.</p>

<p>The officer told me that the garrison of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-93" id="Pg_2-93"></a>[<a href="./images/2-93.png">93</a>]</span>
Birjand consisted of one thousand men, about
one hundred of whom were stationed in Birjand
itself, the rest being scattered in the villages
around and at one or two posts along the Afghan
frontier. For the accuracy of this statement,
however, I leave the entire responsibility to the
officer.</p>

<p>He was much distressed when I inquired
whether the soldiers were ever drilled in artillery
practice, and he said it could not be done
because they had not sufficient ammunition, but
they possessed some gunpowder. He agreed
with me that artillery would be of little use if
there was no one who knew how to use it, and
no ammunition at hand!</p>

<p>Birjand being so near the Afghan frontier and
having direct roads to Meshed, Herat, Sabzawar,
Anardar, Farah, Lash, Sistan, Beluchistan, Bandar
Abbas, Kerman, Yezd, Isfahan, and Teheran, is
a place of interest from a strategic point of view.
In its present condition it could not possibly
offer any resistance. The city and citadel can be
commanded from many points on the hills to the
north-east and east, and the citadel&mdash;even
allowing that it were strong enough to make
a resistance&mdash;could be shelled with the greatest
ease at close range from the hill on which now
stands the ruined fortress west of the city. This
point could be reached in perfect safety and would
afford absolute cover under fire from the citadel,
but with modern artillery even of moderate
calibre would prove fatal to the citadel itself.</p>

<p>Birjand is probably the greatest commercial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-94" id="Pg_2-94"></a>[<a href="./images/2-94.png">94</a>]</span>
centre in Eastern Persia, its transit trade at various
seasons of the year being very extensive from
all the routes above-mentioned. Agriculturally,
Birjand could not even support its own population,
for the water supply is scanty and bad.
There is no fresh water obtainable in the city,
but brackish water is a little more plentiful. A
small spring of good water is, however, to be
found some two miles from the city, and there I
daily sent a man to bring us a supply.</p>

<p>In war time, therefore, the city could not
support nor aid an army, which would fare
badly if locked up here. Possibly in some
seasons it might supply some camels, horses and
mules, but no food.</p>

<p>That the Persians themselves believe this an
untenable place in time of war is evident, as this
is one of the few large cities in Persia which is
not surrounded by a wall.</p>

<p>The Amir, or Governor, does not live in
Birjand itself but half a farsakh, or two miles,
across the plains to the S.S.E., where he has a
handsome residence in a pretty garden. Much
to my regret I was too unwell to go and pay my
respects to him, although I carried an introduction
to him from H.R.H. Zil-es-Sultan, the
Shah's brother. He very kindly sent to inquire
after my health several times during my stay,
and the Karghazar was deputed to come and
convey these messages to me.</p>

<p>One cannot speak too highly of the extreme
civility of Persian officials if one travels in their
country properly accredited and in the right way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-95" id="Pg_2-95"></a>[<a href="./images/2-95.png">95</a>]</span>
If one does not, naturally one only has to blame
one's self for the consequences.</p>

<p>One hears a good deal about the advantages of
being a Britisher in any country, and one could
not help being amused at the natives of Birjand
who could not distinguish a European from the
blackest Bengalese. They were all <i>Inglis</i> to
them. Some natives came to announce that a
caravan of twenty of my own countrymen had
just arrived&mdash;which gave me quite a pleasant
surprise, although I could hardly credit its truth.
On rushing out of my room to greet them, I
found myself confronted with a crowd of black-faced,
impudent, untidy Indian pilgrims from
Bengal, on their way to the Sacred Shrine of
Meshed. Most of them were fever-stricken;
others, they told me, had died on the way.</p>

<p>These caravans have caused a good deal of
friction both with the Persian and Russian
authorities, for fear that they should bring
plague into Persia and Transcaspia. When one
saw these fanatics&mdash;religious people can be so
dirty&mdash;one could not with any fairness blame
the authorities for making a fuss and taking
stringent measures to protect their own countries
and people from probable infection. True, it
should be remembered that the journey of 600
miles across the hot Baluchistan desert to
Sistan, and the 500 more miles to Meshed,
ought to have been a sufficient disinfectant as
far as the plague went, but their wretched
appearance was decidedly against them.</p>

<p>These pilgrims were a great nuisance; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-96" id="Pg_2-96"></a>[<a href="./images/2-96.png">96</a>]</span>
traded on the fact that they were under British
protection; they lived in the most abject
fashion, continually haggling and quarrelling
with the natives, and decidedly did not add to
our popularity in Eastern Persia, to say nothing
of the endless trouble and worry they gave to
our officials at the Consulates and on the route.</p>

<p>As I have said, the natives do not know the
difference between these men and Englishmen,
and believe that all British subjects are of the
same stamp&mdash;by which one cannot quite feel
flattered. If these pilgrimages could be gradually
restricted and eventually stopped, I think
everybody all round would benefit,&mdash;even the
pilgrims themselves, who might possibly not
feel so holy, but whose health would not be
impaired by the fearful sufferings they have to
endure to gain&mdash;and often obtain very prematurely&mdash;a
claim to a seat in heaven.</p>

<p>The opening up of the Nushki route from
Quetta to Sistan and Meshed is responsible for
the great influx of pilgrims, who have been
attracted by the glowing reports of how easy it
is to travel by this route. And so it is very
easy, for men accustomed to that particular kind
of travelling, like myself or like traders or
Government officials, who can travel with all
they want, and just as they please, but not for
people who have to live from hand to mouth
and who are destitute of everything. Those
fellows have no idea whatever, when they start, of
what they will have to endure on the road.</p>

<p>There is not much local trade in Birjand, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-97" id="Pg_2-97"></a>[<a href="./images/2-97.png">97</a>]</span>
quite a brisk transit trade. The industries are
practically confined to carpet-weaving, the carpets
being renowned all over Persia for their
softness, smooth texture, and colours, which are
said never to fade, but the designs upon them
are not always very graceful nor the colours
always artistically matched. The most curious
and durable are the camel-hair ones, but the
design, usually with a very large medallion in
the centre, does not seem to appeal to European
eyes. Even the smallest rugs fetch very large
sums. Although called Birjand carpets they are
mostly manufactured in some of the villages
north of Birjand, especially at Darakush.</p>

<p>Among the shops there are a few silversmiths',
some blacksmiths', and some sword and gunsmiths'.
The latter manufacture fairly good
blades and picturesque matchlocks.</p>

<p>The trade caravanserais in the town are
quaint, but to me most interesting of all was
the one approached by a sharp incline&mdash;a very
old one&mdash;where an Indian British trader had
started business, attempting to further British
trade in these regions. This man, by name
Umar-al-din Khan, of the firm of Mahommed
Ali of Quetta, was really a remarkable fellow.
If Russian trade has not yet succeeded in getting
a fair hold in Birjand, if British trade has it so
far almost altogether its own way, we have only
to thank the tact, energy, patience, and talent of
this man. The patriotism, enterprise, and hard
labour of Umar-al-din and his firm deserve
indeed the greatest credit and gratitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-98" id="Pg_2-98"></a>[<a href="./images/2-98.png">98</a>]</span></p>

<p>Birjand is a most interesting point commercially
because it will be here that Russian
and British competition in Eastern Persia will
eventually come into collision.</p>

<p>The main imports of the province of Kain,
of which Birjand is the capital, are now English
and Russian made merchandise. English goods
are so far preferred and realize higher prices,
because of their better quality. The articles
principally required, and for which in retail the
natives are ready to pay well, are ordinary
cotton, woollen and silk cloths, household iron,
copper, brass vessels, loaf-sugar, glass-ware and
crockery, especially of shapes suitable for Persian
uses. Indian tea sold very well at first, but
the market is greatly overstocked at present and
great caution should be exercised by Indian
exporters.</p>

<p>Russian sugar, being of a much cheaper quality,
is rapidly driving out of the place French and
Indian sugars, but the quality of Russian sugar is
so bad that of late there has been rather a reaction
in favour of Shahjahanpur Rosa (Indian)
sugar.</p>

<p>There are in Birjand several native merchants
having fair amounts of capital at their disposal,
but it appears that the prices which they are
willing to pay are so low and the credit required
so long, that it is most difficult to do business
with them. The retail business is, therefore,
more profitable than the wholesale.</p>

<p>The competition in Russian-made cotton
cloths and tea is getting very keen and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-99" id="Pg_2-99"></a>[<a href="./images/2-99.png">99</a>]</span>
Russians can sell these things so cheaply that it
is not possible for Indian traders to sell at
their prices. Also the Russians have learnt to
manufacture the stuff exactly as required by the
natives.</p>

<p>The glass ware and fancy goods are chiefly
sold to the better class people, but no very great
profits, especially to passing trading caravans, can
be assured on such articles.</p>

<p>The exports consist of wool and skins to
Russia, and to Bandar Abbas for India; carpets
to Russia, Europe and India; <i>Barak</i>, a kind of
woollen cloth, to various parts of Persia; opium
to China <i>via</i> Bandar Abbas; saffron, caraway
seeds, <i>onaabs</i>, etc., to India, also <i>via</i> Bandar
Abbas, and some English and Russian merchandize
to Herat.</p>

<p>Birjand is the commercial pivot, not only of
the trade of North-eastern Persia, but also of
Western Afghanistan. The commercial supremacy
of this town will decide whether we are able in
the future to hold our own in the south or not;
but once driven back from this centre we may as
well&mdash;commercially&mdash;say good-bye altogether to
the northern and central Persian markets; while
even the southern markets will be very seriously
attacked, as far as goods coming overland are
concerned.</p>

<p>Umar-al-din has made a most careful and
serious study of the trade of Eastern Persia, and I
am certain that if we were to encourage a number
of other Indian traders of the same type to
establish themselves in Birjand, with possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-100" id="Pg_2-100"></a>[<a href="./images/2-100.png">100</a>]</span>
branches in Meshed, England could make rapid
headway against any foreign competition. Being
an Asiatic himself, although Umar-al-din has
travelled, I believe, in Australia, England, etc.,
and speaks Hindustani, Persian and English
perfectly, he is able to deal with the Persians in
a way in which a European would not be so
successful. He is on most friendly terms with
H. E. Shan-kal-el-Mulk, the Governor, and all
the local officials, by whom he is held in much
respect and who have at various times made most
extensive purchases in his shop to the amount of
several thousand tomans' (dollars) worth of British
goods.</p>

<p>On one occasion he imported for the Amir and
his son a first-class double barrel English gun of
the latest type, some revolvers, a bicycle, with a
lot of European furniture for which he received
immediate payment in cash of 4,000 rupees.</p>

<p>Umar-al-din was the first Indian trader to open
a shop in Birjand. By this means he has exercised
great influence over the Persian merchants
of the place, and has induced the leading ones
to trade with India, in preference to Russia, by
the Nushki-Quetta route. His good work has
been reported to Government by Major Chevenix
Trench, then H. B. M. Consul in Sistan, now
Consul in Meshed, by Lieutenant-Colonel
Temple, Major Benn, and others.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Birjand he acted as Agent for
the British Government, and was for ten months in
charge of the Consular postal arrangements from
Sistan to Meshed, while advising the Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-101" id="Pg_2-101"></a>[<a href="./images/2-101.png">101</a>]</span>
on the best ways of promoting trade in those
regions, a work which he did mostly for love
and out of loyalty.</p>

<p>He has experimented a great deal, and his
experience is that indigo is the article which
commands the greatest sale at present, then plain
white and indigo dyed cottons of two qualities, a
superior kind with shiny surface for the better
classes, and one rather inferior with no gloss for
the lower people. Fancy articles find no sale.</p>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties that a trader
has to contend with is the impossibility of selling
anything for ready money, and thus making small
but quick profits. Credit has to be given generally
for one year, eighteen months, and even as
long as two years. Even in the few cases where
credit has been allowed for one or two months
the greatest difficulty is experienced in obtaining
payment for the goods supplied, threats and applications
to the Amir being often necessary. Delays
are constant, although the money is always paid
in the end.</p>

<p>This necessitates keeping the prices very high
to compensate for the loss, but by careful handling
good profits can be made, if sufficient capital is
at hand to keep the concern going.</p>

<p>The caravanserai in which Umar-al-din had
hired several rooms which he had turned into a
shop was now known by the name of the English
Caravanserai, and nearly all the caravans with
Indian and Afghan goods halted there. When
I went to visit the place there were a number of
Afghan soldiers who had conveyed some prisoners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-102" id="Pg_2-102"></a>[<a href="./images/2-102.png">102</a>]</span>
who had escaped into Afghan territory, back from
Herat to Birjand. Their rifles, with bayonets
fixed, were stacked on the platform outside, and
they loitered about, no two soldiers dressed alike.
Some had old English military uniforms which
they wore over their ample white or blue cotton
trousers. These fellows looked very fierce and
treacherous, with cruel mouths and unsteady
eyes. They wore pointed embroidered peaks
inside their turbans, and curly hair flowed upon
their shoulders. At a distance they were most
picturesque but extremely dirty.</p>

<p>A number of Beluch <i>mari</i>, or running camels,
were being fed with huge balls of paste which
were stuffed down their mouths by their owners.
These camel men were the first Beluch I had
come across, and although they wore huge white
flowing robes, long hair, and pointed turbans not
unlike the Afghans, the difference in the features
and expression of the faces was quite marked.
One could see that they were fighting people, but
they had nice, honest faces; they looked straight
in one's eyes, and had not the sneakish countenance
of their northern neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the morning of the 26th I was
awakened by a fearful explosion that shook the
caravanserai and made everything in the room
rattle. A few minutes later there was a second
report and then a third and fourth, twelve altogether,
but these fortunately not quite so loud.
Evidently my military friends of the previous day
were firing off their artillery.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, in their gaudy uniforms and
with a guard of soldiers, the officers came to call
upon me at the caravanserai.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the guns being fired?" was
their first anxious question. Indeed I had. It
appears that to make sure that I should hear them
a double charge of powder was placed in the first
gun. When it was let off in the very small
court of the citadel the concussion had most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-104" id="Pg_2-104"></a>[<a href="./images/2-104.png">104</a>]</span>
disastrous effects upon the mud walls all round,
as well as upon some of the spectators who were
close at hand and who were nearly stunned by
the fearful report.</p>

<p>The officers were extremely civil, intelligent
and full of humour. Intense astonishment and
interest was shown in my repeating rifles.
They had never set their eyes upon, nor ever
heard that there was such a thing as, a repeating
rifle! I was, nevertheless, much struck by their
quickness compared with that of the average
European, in grasping the mechanism and the
way to use the weapons.</p>

<p>They seemed fully to realize that it would be
of little practical use to defend Birjand city in
case of an attack, because it could be commanded
from several excellent positions close at hand to
the north-east, north and north-west. Furthermore,
the water supply could easily be cut off.
They told me, if I remember right, that it was
the intention of the Persian Government to
strengthen this place and that some more pieces
of artillery were expected.</p>

<p>We have in Birjand an Indian doctor, by name
Abbas Ali Khan, who acts as British Agent. He
is a young fellow of uncommon ability and
education, a capital doctor, and a most gentlemanly
man, who has had great experience of the
world, having travelled with several political
missions in various parts of Asia, including the
Pekin Syndicate Survey expedition under command
of J. W. Purvis, Captain R. E., where not
only did he look after the medical necessities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-105" id="Pg_2-105"></a>[<a href="./images/2-105.png">105</a>]</span>
a large party of Europeans, Indians and Chinese,
but helped to manage a large transport of mule
carts. Captain Purvis testifies to Abbas Ali
having performed his professional duties with
zeal, and extraneous duties cheerfully, during a
journey of some 2,000 miles through China.</p>

<p>It was in April, 1897, that Abbas Ali Khan, at
twenty-four hours' notice, accompanied Major
Brazier Creagh's Mission to Sistan, when British
influence in that part of Persia was non-existent.
The Mission returned to India in October of the
same year, but Abbas Ali was sent on a second
journey to Sistan in charge of a small party
from December, 1897, to July, 1898, when he
was entrusted with political business which
required great discretion and tact.</p>

<p>It is greatly to his credit that he managed&mdash;in
spite of many difficulties and obstacles&mdash;to win
the confidence and friendship of officials of a
district where all British subjects were regarded
with undisguised suspicion and distrust. No
better proof of this could be furnished than by
reproducing here a literal translation of a quaint
document, dated May, 1898, given him, unsolicited,
by Mir Masum Sar-tip, Deputy Governor
of Sistan, whose official seal it bears:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"God is acquainted with what is in the minds of men.
Beyond doubt and without hesitation it is rightly and
justly stated that Military Doctor Mirza Abbas Ali
Khan has during the period of his stay in Sistan
displayed his personal tact and natural ability. He
has treated with great civility and politeness any person
who has applied to him for medical attendance and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-106" id="Pg_2-106"></a>[<a href="./images/2-106.png">106</a>]</span>
treatment of diseases, and has in no case whatever
demanded payment or anything from anybody. He
has never hesitated to give gratuitous medical aid with
medicines or personal attendance, and all the natives
from the highest to the lowest are well satisfied and
under great obligation to him. It is hoped that the
trouble taken and the pecuniary loss suffered by him
will be appreciated by his Government. I have personally
greatly benefited by his treatment of my personal
diseases and ailments and I trust that he will receive
great favour from his Government."</p></div>

<p>Naturally the medicines are supplied to him
by the Government, but it would be becoming
if the Government saw its way to reward men
of this type for the "soul" which they put into
their work, for this it is after all that wins the
esteem of the natives more than the actual cost
of the medicines. A few grains of quinine, or
a few ounces of castor oil have often been the
means of obtaining information and advantages
for the British Government, which, if properly
used, may be worth millions of pounds sterling.</p>

<p>It is to these pioneers that the nation should
be grateful, to these people who build sound
foundations on which the Empire can spread
without fear of collapsing we are indebted far
more than to the folks who stop at home and
reap with little trouble the credit of the work
which has been done by others.</p>

<p>Abbas Ali has gained a most intimate knowledge
of the country and people, which gives
him enormous influence, and he has been the
means of smoothing the way to a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-107" id="Pg_2-107"></a>[<a href="./images/2-107.png">107</a>]</span>
extent for the new trade route to Quetta. Major
Chevenix Trench, Consul at Meshed, fully
testifies to this, and speaks very highly of
Abbas Ali's political work, and so does Captain
Webb-Ware, in charge of the Nushki-Sistan
road, who writes that in his belief the growth
of British influence in Sistan and Birjand is due
in no small degree to the tact, discretion, and
conscientious discharge of duties of Abbas Ali.</p>

<p>Abbas Ali was ordered again to Persia in
August, 1899, and has remained there since,
stationed at Birjand.</p>

<p>The Russians have established a rival agent
to look after their own interests, in the person of
Veziroff Gazumbek, a Perso-Russian subject
and a Mussulman. This man very politely
called upon me in great state, wearing a decoration
of the third class which had just been bestowed
upon him by the Shah, and accompanied by four
Cossacks who were on their way to the Russian
Consulate at Sistan to relieve the escort there.
He and Abbas Ali were socially and outwardly
on excellent terms, but great rivalry necessarily
existed in their work.</p>

<p>The Russian had gained a temporary advantage
in the eyes of the natives by the honour
conferred upon him by the Shah, and it was a
pity that an exception to the general rule could
not be made and a similar or higher honour
obtained for Abbas Ali, whose work certainly
deserves&mdash;one would think&mdash;some consideration.
Matters of that sort, although of absolutely no
significance in themselves, are of great import<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-108" id="Pg_2-108"></a>[<a href="./images/2-108.png">108</a>]</span>ance
in a country like Persia, where appearances
cannot altogether be neglected.</p>

<p>The British Government, one feels, makes a
primary and most palpable mistake in not being
represented by more English Consular officials,
not necessarily sent by the London Foreign
Office, but rather of that most excellent type,
the military Political servants, such as those who
are now found in some few Persian cities. The
establishment of a vice-Consulate here at Birjand
instead of a Medical Political Agency would, I
think, also, be of very great help at the present
moment and would increase British prestige
there.</p>

<p>The afternoon of that day was spent in returning
the visits of Abbas Ali Khan, the Russian
Agent, and the Karghazar. Everywhere I met
with extreme civility. Both the British and the
Russian Agent lived in nice houses, handsomely
carpeted and furnished, only Abbas Ali's place
had a more business-like appearance than that
of the Russian because of the many books, the
red cross trunks of medicine and surgical instruments
and folding camp furniture. The house
of the Russian was practically in Persian style,
with handsome carpets and cushions, but with
hardly any European chairs or furniture.</p>

<p>Birjand is very high up, 5,310 ft. above sea
level, and we did not feel any too warm. The
thermometer was seldom more than 60&deg; in the
shade during the day, and from 40&deg; to 50&deg; at night.</p>

<p>In the evenings the four Cossacks of the Sistan
Consular escort, who had been detained here, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-109" id="Pg_2-109"></a>[<a href="./images/2-109.png">109</a>]</span>
occupied one of the rooms of the caravanserai,
sat out in the open singing with melodious
voices in a chorus the weird songs of their country.
These men were really wonderful. They had
come down from Turkestan, a journey of close
upon five hundred miles, riding their own horses,
with only a few roubles in their pockets, and
little more than the clothing they wore, their
rifles, and bandoliers of cartridges. The affection
for their horses was quite touching, and it
was fully reciprocated by the animals. One or
two of the men slept by the horses so that no
one should steal them, and the animals were
constantly and tenderly looked after.</p>

<p>There was a bright scene in the graveyard
behind the caravanserai, the day that all the
women went to visit the graves and to lay
offerings of food, rice and dried fruit upon the
tombs of their dead. Little conical white tents
were pitched by hawkers, and dozens of women
in their white chudders prowled about like so
many ghosts, or else squatted down in rows
beside or upon the graves. The doleful voices of
blind beggars sang mournful tunes, and cripples
of all kinds howled for charity.</p>

<p>A Persian crowd is always almost colourless, and
hardly relieved by an occasional touch of green in
the men's kamarbands or a bright spot of vermilion
in the children's clothes. The illustration representing
the scene, shows on the left-hand
side of the observer, the ruined fortress at the
western end of the city of Birjand, and the
near range of hills to the north-west which, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-110" id="Pg_2-110"></a>[<a href="./images/2-110.png">110</a>]</span>
I mentioned, would afford most excellent positions
for artillery for commanding Birjand. The domed
building in the centre of the photograph is one
of the dead-houses adjoining every cemetery in
Persia, to which the bodies are conveyed and
prepared previous to interment.</p>

<p>The Persian Government have a Belgian
Customs official in Birjand, but he generally
spends much of his time travelling along the
Afghan frontier. He had left Birjand when I
arrived.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-022.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-022_th.jpg" alt="Women Visiting Graves of Relatives, Birjand. (Ruined Fort can be observed on Hill.)" title="Women Visiting Graves of Relatives, Birjand. (Ruined Fort can be observed on Hill.)" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Women Visiting Graves of Relatives, Birjand.</span> (Ruined Fort can be observed on Hill.)</p>

<p>With more pity than regret I watched at the
caravanserai the departure of the Indian pilgrims
for the Shrine at Meshed. They had obtained a
number of donkeys and mules, and were having
endless rows with the natives about payment.
Eventually, however, the caravanserai court having
been a pandemonium for several hours, all was
settled, their rags were packed in bundles upon
the saddles, and the skeleton-like pilgrims, shivering
with fever, were shoved upon the top of the
loads. There was more fanaticism than life left
in them.</p>

<p>The four Cossacks, also, who were at the
caravanserai received orders to leave at once for
their post at Sistan, and gaily departed in charge
of the British Consular courier who was to show
them the way.</p>

<p>This courier travels from Meshed to Sistan
with relays of two horses each, in connection
with the Quetta-Sistan postal service. The service
is worked entirely by the Consuls and by the Agent
at Birjand, and is remarkably good and punctual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-111" id="Pg_2-111"></a>[<a href="./images/2-111.png">111</a>]</span>
considering the difficulties encountered. There
is also a Persian postal service of some sort,
but unfortunate is the person who rashly entrusts
letters to it. Even the Persian officials themselves
prefer to use the English post. The Russians
have established a similar service from their
frontier to Sistan, but it does not run so frequently.</p>

<p>The making up a second caravan in a hurry
was no easy matter, but eventually I was able to
persuade one of the men who had accompanied
me across the Salt Desert to procure fresh camels
and convey me there. This he did, and after a
halt of three days we were on the road again to
cross our third desert between Birjand and Sistan,
a distance of some 210 miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A large</span> and most respectful crowd collected in
and out of the caravanserai to watch the departure
of my caravan at five o'clock in the evening on
November 27th. We were soon out of Birjand
and, steering a south-easterly course, passed one
or two large mud enclosures with a few fruit-trees,
but otherwise there was hardly any
vegetation visible anywhere&mdash;even in the immediate
neighbourhood of Birjand. Everything
was as barren as barren could be.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky after sunset was most
peculiarly marked by a weird, black, skeleton-like
hand of perfect but gigantic proportions,
spreading its long bony fingers over us. As
night came on, it grew very cold and the
skeleton hand of mist compressed itself into a
nasty black cloud. A few minutes later a regular
downpour drenched us to the skin and the camels
experienced great difficulty in walking on the
slippery mud.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-113" id="Pg_2-113"></a>[<a href="./images/2-113.png">113</a>]</span></p>

<p>This was the first rain we had seen, or rather
felt, since leaving Teheran. Our long-unused
macintoshes had been applied to such usages as
wrapping up cases of photographic plates and enveloping
notebooks, so that we could not very well
get at them, now that we needed them, without
taking all the loads down. So we went on until
our clothes were perfectly saturated, when at
least we had the satisfaction of knowing that we
could not get wetter than we were.</p>

<p>The rain came down in bucketfuls for over
an hour, then luckily stopped, and in a few
moments, with a howling wind rising, the sky
was clear again and the myriads of stars shone
bright like so many diamonds. The cutting
wind and our wet clothes made this march rather
a chilly one, although one felt some relief at the
sensation of moisture after so many months of
intense dryness.</p>

<p>There was nothing whatever to see on any side,
and I have never thanked my stars so much as
when, after marching thirteen hours, we reached
the village of Muht, a place of fair size in a
picturesque little valley with nice hills on all
sides.</p>

<p>To the north-east of the village was an interesting
demolished fortress standing on a low
hill. It had a very deep well in the centre
within its walls, which were of stone, with
twelve turrets round it. At the foot of the hill
was a <i>haoz</i>, or water tank, now dry, which the
natives said was very ancient and which they
attributed to the Hindoos. To the west a lake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-114" id="Pg_2-114"></a>[<a href="./images/2-114.png">114</a>]</span>
was said to exist called Kiemarakalah, by the side
of a mountain not unlike a Swiss roof in shape;
while to the north-east of the fortress were rugged
rocks and low sand-hills. The elevation of this
village was 6,520 feet.</p>

<p>We left Muht at noon of the same day and
passed a small village on our way, then we
gradually ascended to a pass 7,050 feet high, on
the other side of which was a plain&mdash;green not
from vegetation, but because the clayish soil was
of that colour&mdash;with hills to the east and west.</p>

<p>It was hardly possible to imagine more dreary,
desolate scenery than that through which we
were going. There was not a living soul beyond
ourselves anywhere in sight. The camels, which
had caught cold in the shower of the previous
night, had to be given a rest, and we halted again
after a five hours' march. The cold was intense.
Whether owing to the moisture in the atmosphere,
or to some other cause, we had on the
evening of the 28th a really beautiful sunset.
The sky was dazzling with brilliant gold and
vermilion tints.</p>

<p>At midnight we were again under way, first
across flat, then over undulating country, after
which we got among the mountains and between
precipitous gorges. This was quite a welcome
change, but not for the camels, the way being
somewhat rough and stony.</p>

<p>We had some little difficulty in going up the
steep pass, 7,200 feet, the camels panting
terribly. We suffered from the cold and the
heavy dew which positively drenched men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-115" id="Pg_2-115"></a>[<a href="./images/2-115.png">115</a>]</span>
camels, and baggage. It was quite as bad as
having been out in the rain, we were so soaked.
I, unfortunately, became ill again, fever attacking
me afresh more fiercely than ever; Sadek,
too, and Abbas Ali, the camel man, were also
taken very sick.</p>

<p>On the other side of the pass we went
through a steep, narrow, and most fantastically
picturesque defile of rocks, and eventually passed
the little hamlet of Golandeh which boasts of
no less than half-a-dozen mud huts and as many
fruit trees.</p>

<p>We had descended to precisely the altitude of
Muht, or 6,520 feet. From this village the Sistan
track descends for a few hundred yards and then
proceeds in a south by south-east direction over
a flat stretch with some hills. A very high
mountain could be seen to the south by south-west
and another quite pointed to the south by
south-east (at 170&deg; b.m.). To the east-south-east
some twenty miles from Muht, was another
tiny hamlet built against the foot of the mountain
along which we had come. A large plain
opened before us to the south-west.</p>

<p>At Golandeh we were besieged by natives
applying for medicine, as there seemed to be
hardly a soul in the place who was not affected
by some complaint or other. Affections of the
eyes were most common. Those who wanted
no medicine begged for money or lumps of
sugar,&mdash;which latter there is apparently some
difficulty in obtaining here and for which they
seemed to have a perfect craving. Men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-116" id="Pg_2-116"></a>[<a href="./images/2-116.png">116</a>]</span>
women, and children implored to be given
some.</p>

<p>There were two towers at Golandeh, the
lower one quadrangular in shape and two-storied.
The upper floor had recesses in all the rooms for
storing grain and provisions.</p>

<p>We left camp at 5.45 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and all went well
until about ten o'clock, when Sadek took it into
his head that we were travelling in the wrong
direction and proceeded to put us right, I being
fast asleep on my camel. The camel man,
having never been on this route, did not know
the way and depended a great deal on the
bearings I gave him daily by my compass.
When I awoke we had got sadly mixed up
among big boulders and sharp broken-up rocks,
from which the camels had the greatest difficulty
in extricating themselves, and we wasted
a good deal of time in helping the animals
to get on to better ground as they continually
stumbled and fell among the loose
stones. The loads got undone several times
and we were all three so ill that we had not
the strength to tie them up again properly on
the saddles.</p>

<p>In the course of time I put the party on the
right track again, and for more than one hour
we went up and down steep but not high passes,
through defiles, and across a small stream. We
were following the dry river-bed among rocks in
a gorge, and we arrived at a spot where there was
a rock barrier several feet high beneath us,
which made it impossible for camels to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-117" id="Pg_2-117"></a>[<a href="./images/2-117.png">117</a>]</span>
down; so Abbas Ali was despatched to try and
find an easier way while Sadek and I were left
to freeze in a cutting south-west wind.</p>

<p>The camel man returned and led the camels
back a long distance until we came to a faint
track along a streamlet, which we tried to
follow, but it went along such precipitous
places that we had to abandon it for fear the
camels, who could not get a proper foot-hold,
might come to grief. In Birjand I
had only succeeded in obtaining just sufficient
animals to carry my loads, Sadek, and myself,
and so was not very anxious to run the risk of
losing any and becoming stranded in such an
inhospitable place.</p>

<p>We eventually contrived to take the camels
down to the flat without any serious mishaps,
and wandered and wandered about and went
over another pass&mdash;my compass being all we
had to go by.</p>

<p>Sadek, whose high fever had affected his
vision, now swore that we were going back
towards Birjand instead of going on, and said
he was certain my compass was wrong; but I
paid no heed to his remarks, and by carefully
steering our course with the compass&mdash;which
involved a reckless waste of matches owing to
the high wind&mdash;I eventually got the party into
the open, upon a wide plain of sand and gravel.
Here, having shown Abbas Ali the right
bearings to follow, I got upon my camel, again
wrapped myself well in my blankets and went
fast asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-118" id="Pg_2-118"></a>[<a href="./images/2-118.png">118</a>]</span></p>

<p>So unfortunately did Abbas Ali, who was tired
out after his exertions among the rocks, and at
3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I woke up to find the camels going as
and where they pleased, and the camel man,
buried under his thick felt coat, snoring so
soundly upon his camel that it took a good deal
of shouting to wake him up. I had no idea
where we had drifted while I had been asleep,
and the night being an unusually dark one we
could not well see what was ahead of us, so we
decided to halt until sunrise.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-023.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-023_th.jpg" alt="In the Desert. (Tamarisks in the Foreground.)" title="In the Desert. (Tamarisks in the Foreground.)" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">In the Desert.</span> (Tamarisks in the Foreground.)</p>

<p>When it grew light in the morning I was
much interested in some curious circular and
quadrangular pits only a few yards from
where we had stopped, which were used as
shelters for men and sheep but were now deserted.
These pits were from four to six feet deep below
the level of the ground, and from ten to thirty
feet in diameter (when circular), a section being
partitioned for sheep by a fence of thick but soft
cane that grows in the neighbourhood of water.
In the part reserved for human beings there was
a circular fireplace of stones, and some holes in
the earth at the sides for storing foodstuff. The
lower portion of the inside wall all round the pit
was of beaten earth up to a height of two feet,
above which a wall of stones carefully fitted one
upon the other was constructed from two to four
feet high, up to the level of the earth. Here a
projecting screen of cane was erected all round
at an angle converging towards the centre of the
pit, for the double purpose of preventing the
sheep escaping, and of sheltering the inmates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-119" id="Pg_2-119"></a>[<a href="./images/2-119.png">119</a>]</span>
during the fearful sand and windstorms that
sweep with great force along the earth's surface.
The entrance was cut on one side with an incline
to afford easy access to the pit.</p>

<p>At this particular place there were altogether
some fifteen of these pits, and in one of them
we lighted a big fire with some shrubs we
collected, and rested for some three hours to give
Sadek time to cook my breakfast.</p>

<p>The difference in the temperature between the
interior of these pits and the open ground was
extraordinary. They were comfortably warm,
even when it was unpleasantly cold as one peeped
out of them.</p>

<p>While Sadek was busy with his culinary work,
and the camel man chewed dried pieces of bread
and <i>keshk</i> cheese, I proceeded to find our right
way. It lay about one mile to the east of the
pits.</p>

<p>On resuming our march, five farsakhs (twenty
miles) from Golandeh, we reached Sahlabad, an
unimportant village. South there was to be seen
an extensive white salt deposit, which at first had
all the appearance of a large lake, and a stream
of salt water flowed across the large valley and
through the village from north-east to south-west.</p>

<p>To the east there was a long range of multi-coloured
mountains, all with high sand accumulations
at their base; greys in several beautiful
tones, were prevalent, and there were stretches of
black, brown, burnt sienna, and a pale cadmium
yellow. To the north-west, whence we had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-120" id="Pg_2-120"></a>[<a href="./images/2-120.png">120</a>]</span>
come, low hills were visible, and to the south-west
fairly high ones.</p>

<p>Sahlabad was a depressing place. The natives
were in abject poverty and their habitations
dismal, to say the least. The huts were partly
underground, and the top aperture of the domed
roof was screened by a hood with an opening to
the north-east. No firewood was obtainable at
this place, and the only water the natives had to
drink was the salt water from the stream. At
Sahlabad we had descended to an elevation of
5,050 ft., which made a considerable change in
the temperature.</p>

<p>We encountered here a large caravan in
charge of Beluch drivers, and among other
curious articles one of the camels carried a
beautiful new enamelled iron bedstead. The
reader may suppose that, after several months of
sleeping on the ground, I wished it had been
mine,&mdash;but I did not. On the contrary, I was
particularly struck on that occasion by what an
elaborate, clumsy, useless thing it seemed,
although, as bedsteads go, it was one of the
best!</p>

<p>To the south stood a high mountain, very
closely resembling in shape the world-renowned
Fujiama of Japan, only this one had a somewhat
wider angle. Beyond the white expanse of salt
to the south-east there was low, flattish country,
but to the west, north-west and south-west, rose
fairly high hills. The valley itself in which we
were was some two and a half miles broad, and
covered with grey sand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-121" id="Pg_2-121"></a>[<a href="./images/2-121.png">121</a>]</span></p>

<p>In the centre of the village in the neighbourhood
of which we camped was a tumbled-down
circular tower, and an octangular tower in two
tiers, also partly ruined. The latter stood at the
corner of an enclosure which at one time must
have been the beginning of the village wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> remained at Sahlabad the whole afternoon,
and we were visited in camp by a number of
suspicious-looking people, who were most
inquisitive to know what I possessed and how
much money I carried, and other such pertinent
questions which they put to Sadek and my camel
man. Also a peculiar lot of fellows, with very
ugly countenances and armed to their teeth,
passed by. They were mounted on fine horses
with gaudy saddles, and on coming suddenly and
unexpectedly upon us seemed quite upset. Instead
of salaaming us, as had been usual with the
few well-to-do people we had so far met, they
whipped their horses and galloped away.</p>

<p>Sadek said they must be Sawars&mdash;mounted
soldiers. Abbas Ali said they were robbers from
Afghanistan. We shall see later what they
were.</p>

<p>At 6.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we left&mdash;it was quite dark&mdash;and
we had gone but two miles when a distant voice
called upon us to stop. By his speech the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-123" id="Pg_2-123"></a>[<a href="./images/2-123.png">123</a>]</span>
stranger seemed very excited when he reached
us, and said we must keep the track, to the left
and not follow the one to the right where two
trails branched off. We could not see his face,
for he kept some twenty or thirty yards off, and
besides, his face was wrapped all round in the
tail of his turban. We professed to be thankful
for the information, but continued on the track
to the right, which seemed greatly to disturb him&mdash;at
least, judging by the number of times he
entreated us to follow his advice.</p>

<p>Both Sadek and Abbas Ali corroborated my
conviction that this was a trap laid for us. The
man, on seeing us go a different way from the
one he advised us, ran away, and presently we
heard some shrill whistles which were no doubt
signals to his companions.</p>

<p>We had gone but another mile when suddenly
a figure with a gun in hand sprang before us
and seized the camel man by the chest.</p>

<p>"Whose caravan is this?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"It is the <i>ferenghi's</i>," hastily replied the camel
man.</p>

<p>There was a short pause in the conversation
when our interlocutor, looking up at my camel
which had got close upon him, perceived himself
covered by my rifle.</p>

<p>Sadek had leapt off his camel as quick as
lightning and shoved the muzzle of his Winchester
in the man's face. As the stranger's
demeanour was most peculiar and his answers
incoherent as well as flippant, Sadek first disarmed
his adversary, then turned his own rifle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-124" id="Pg_2-124"></a>[<a href="./images/2-124.png">124</a>]</span>
the round way about and gave the man a good
pounding for his impertinence in holding up my
camel man. We heard a number of voices of
people hidden all around. When the fellow
managed to effect an escape he gave an alarm
signal, and we saw a lot of black figures jump up
and stampede for their lives.</p>

<p>This furnished a little variation in our dreary
night marches, and we proceeded briskly, Sadek,
Abbas Ali and I being most grateful to our unknown
friends for the amusement they had
provided us.</p>

<p>Some three miles further we came upon several
caravans that had halted and were hiding, for
they were aware of robbers being about&mdash;they
had seen fresh tracks of their horses during the
day and were in fear of being attacked. At first
when we appeared on the scene they mistook us
for brigands, and as we discovered them hidden
we also mistook them for robbers, so that the
beginning of our interview did not lack in
humour.</p>

<p>We had a hearty laugh over it all when their
identity and ours were established, and after a few
minutes' halt we continued our journey on soft
sand, rather undulating, with frequent depressions
in places. We travelled the whole night of
December 1st, passing to the right of the salt
deposits&mdash;which looked like a big stretch of
country covered with snow and threw out a
certain luminosity, possibly because the salt crystals
reflected and condensed what light there
was from the stars. As the hours of the night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-125" id="Pg_2-125"></a>[<a href="./images/2-125.png">125</a>]</span>
went by we gradually left the salt stretch behind
us to the north, and proceeded on the flat for
some distance.</p>

<p>In the morning we passed a small village
right up on the mountain side, one mile and
a half to the west of our course. We then
entered a dry river-bed between high sand hills,
and having marched nineteen hours continuously
camels and men were rather in need of a rest.</p>

<p>At one <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on December 1st we pitched our
camp in the middle of the river-bed&mdash;80 feet
broad here&mdash;the only place where we could get
a draught of air,&mdash;but the heat was suffocating,
the thermometer registering 112&deg;&mdash;the altitude
being 5,010 feet.</p>

<p>As we expected to find water of some kind
we had omitted to fill up the skins and load the
camels unnecessarily, but, unluckily, there was
no water anywhere at hand. Abbas Ali was
sent to the village we had passed&mdash;now some
four miles back&mdash;to get some, but being too
tired to carry the heavy skin down to us again
he entrusted it to a boy, giving him full directions
where our camp was. The boy did not
find where we were, and in the meantime Sadek
and I had our throats parched with thirst.
Abbas Ali returned at seven o'clock and had
to be despatched back to the village in search
of the lost boy and the water skin. It was ten
o'clock when he returned, and after twenty-eight
hours of dryness we had our first drink of water.
It was brackish but it tasted delicious.</p>

<p>We were compelled to remain here for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-126" id="Pg_2-126"></a>[<a href="./images/2-126.png">126</a>]</span>
night. Several caravans passed through going
north, and also a lot of suspicious people, whose
manner was so peculiar that we were compelled
to sit up the greater part of the night and keep
watch on my property. Some of the caravan
men who had gone through had warned us that
we had encamped in a regular nest of robbers,
and that three men had been robbed and
murdered at this spot only a few days before.</p>

<p>The high sand hills afford excellent hiding
places for these gentry. It appears that the
men on horseback whom we had seen at
Sahlabad, and who had bolted on coming
suddenly upon us, were the high chief of the
robber band and some of his confederates,&mdash;very
likely on their way to Birjand to dispose
of booty. Being so near the Afghan border
these fellows enjoy practical safety by merely
going from one country into the other to suit
their plans and to evade search parties occasionally
sent out for their capture.</p>

<p>We had come forty miles from Sahlabad, and
Abbas Ali brought us the news from the village
that we should find no water on our course for
fifteen miles more and no habitations for forty-eight
more miles. Unluckily, we had hardly
enough provisions to last one day, and we
perceived a fair prospect before us of having to
go one day without food, when Abbas Ali was
despatched for a third time for another eight
miles' walk to the village and back to see what
he could get in the way of edibles.</p>

<p>He returned, riding a cow, in company with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-127" id="Pg_2-127"></a>[<a href="./images/2-127.png">127</a>]</span>
another man, and a third fellow on a mule
carrying a fat sheep. The latter was there and
then purchased and killed, and we had a copious
breakfast before starting along the winding dry
bed of the river at 11.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on December 2nd.</p>

<p>Before us to the south by south-west (190&deg;
b.m.) was a lofty flat-topped mountain which
appeared about fifteen miles off, and directly in
front of our course was also another and more
extensive long, flat-topped mountain stretching
from north-east to south-west, three miles off,
with precipitous sides towards the north-west
and north. The sides were padded with sand
accumulations which reached almost to the
summit of the lower portions of the mountain
barrier. To the south-west, approximately
twenty miles off, stood a high range.</p>

<p>West and north-westerly winds blew every
day in a fierce manner, usually from sunset till
about ten or eleven o'clock the following morning,
at which hour they somewhat abated.
They are, no doubt, due to the great jumps in
the temperature at sunset and sunrise. On
December 1st, for instance, from 112&deg; in the
sun during the day the thermometer dropped to
20&deg; at night, or 12&deg; of frost. On December
2nd at noon it was up again as high as 114&deg;.</p>

<p>We traversed a plain twelve miles long and at
its south-east course, where the mountain ranges
met, there occurred a curious spectacle&mdash;evidently
of volcanic formation. On the top of the black
hills of gravel and sand lying in a confused mass,
as if left so by an upheaval, rose a pinnacle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-128" id="Pg_2-128"></a>[<a href="./images/2-128.png">128</a>]</span>
bright yellow and red stone, with patches of reddish
earth and of a dissimilar texture to the
underlying surface of the hill. There seemed
little doubt that both the rocky pinnacle and the
red earth had been thrown there by some force&mdash;and
under the projecting rocks and masses of
soft earth one could, in fact, find a different
formation altogether, bearing the same characteristics
as the remainder of the hill surface.</p>

<p>This was on the northern slope of that hill.
As the track turned here due east, and rounded,
as it were, this curious mount, we found in reality
on the other side a large, crater-like basin
with lips of confused masses of earth both
vermilion and of vivid burnt sienna colour,
as well as most peculiar mud-heaps in a spiral
formation all round the crater, looking as if worn
into that shape by some boiling liquid substance.
To the south-east, on the very top of a hill of
older formation, was perched at a dangerous
angle another great yellow boulder like the one
we had seen on the north side of the crater. For
a diameter of several hundred yards the earth was
much disturbed.</p>

<p>One mile further south-east, in traversing a
basin a mile broad, it was impossible not to notice
a curious range of hills with some strange
enormous baked boulders&mdash;(they had evidently
been exposed to terrific heat)&mdash;standing upright
or at different angles to the east side of the hills,
stuck partly in the sand and salt with which the
ground was here covered.</p>

<p>Irregular and unsystematic heaps of rock, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-129" id="Pg_2-129"></a>[<a href="./images/2-129.png">129</a>]</span>
which sand had accumulated up to a certain
height, were to be seen to the south, and huge
boulders of rich colour lay scattered here and
there; whereas near the mountains which enclosed
the basin both to south and east there
were thousands of little hillocks of rock and sand
in the most disconnected order.</p>

<p>As we went on, two perpendicular flat-topped
barriers were before us to the east&mdash;like gigantic
walls&mdash;one somewhat higher than the other, and
of a picturesque dark burnt sienna colour in
horizontal strata.</p>

<p>The whole country about here seemed to have
been much deranged at different periods. We
passed hillocks in vertical strata of slate-like
brittle stone, in long quadrangular prisms, but evidently
these strata had solidified in a horizontal
position and had been turned over by a sudden
commotion of the earth. This conclusion was
strengthened by the fact that the same formation
in a horizontal position was noticeable all along,
the strata in one or two places showing strange
distortions, with actual bends, continuing in
curves not unlike the letter S. In the dry
river bed there were large rocks cut into the
shape of tables on a single pillar stand, but these
were, of course, made by the erosion of water,
and at a subsequent date.</p>

<p>Further on we found a tiny stream of salt
water in the picturesque gorge&mdash;as weird and
puzzling a bit of scenery as can be found in
Persia, if one carefully examined each hill, each
rock, and tried to speculate on their formation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-130" id="Pg_2-130"></a>[<a href="./images/2-130.png">130</a>]</span></p>

<p>From the rocks&mdash;a hundred feet or so above
the salt stream,&mdash;we came to a spring&mdash;if one
could call it by that name&mdash;of delicious sweet
water. The water dripped at the rate of about
a tumbler-full an hour, but a gallon or two had
collected in a pool directly under the rock, with
a refreshing border of green grass round it.
We gladly and carefully transferred the liquid
into one of the skins by means of a cup judiciously
handled so as not to take up the deep
sediment of mud in the shallow pool.</p>

<p>We came across a very large caravan from
Quetta in charge of some Beluch drivers, and&mdash;after
one's experience of how things are packed by
Persian caravans&mdash;one was greatly struck by the
neat wooden packing boxes, duly marked and
numbered. I inquired whose caravan it was,
and the Beluch said it belonged to two English
Sahibs who were ten miles behind, and were
expected to catch it up during the night. The
names of the two sahibs were so mispronounced
by the Beluch that I could not, to save my life,
understand what they were.</p>

<p>We halted in the gorge at four o'clock, having
come only sixteen miles from my last camp.
Altitude, 4,440 feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> intended continuing our journey after
dinner. This camp being well screened on all
sides, Sadek gave way to his ambition to have
the camp lighted up by a number of candles,
with which he was always most wasteful. He
had two candles alight where he was doing his
cooking, I had two more to do my writing by,
Abbas Ali had also two to do nothing by.
Luckily, there was not a breath of wind to disturb
the illumination.</p>

<p>Towards nine o'clock we heard noises of
camels' and horses' hoofs stumbling against the
rocks down the gorge, and my ears caught the
welcome sound of English voices.</p>

<p>"What can all those lights be?" said one.</p>

<p>"They look like candles," replied the other.</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> candles!" I intervened. "Will
you not get off your horses and have some dinner
with me by the light of them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-132" id="Pg_2-132"></a>[<a href="./images/2-132.png">132</a>]</span></p>

<p>"Who in the world is that?" queried one of
the riders of the other, evidently taken aback at
being addressed in English in such a queer place
and at such a time of the night.</p>

<p>"My name is Henry Savage Landor."</p>

<p>"What? not Tibet Landor? Our names are
Clemenson and Marsh&mdash;but what in the world
are you doing here? Have you not some
companions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. Here they are: three Persian
kittens!"</p>

<p>As Mr. Clemenson had some big dogs with
him, the moment the cats were let out of the
box to be introduced there was a chase, but the
kittens climbed in due haste up the side of the
cliff and left the disappointed dogs below to
bark. On this high point of vantage they
squatted down and watched our proceedings
below with the greatest interest.</p>

<p>It was a real delight to meet countrymen of
one's own after so many weeks of loneliness.
These two enterprising English traders had
brought over a very large caravan from Quetta,
and were on their way to Meshed, having done
good business in Sistan. They had with them
every possible article they could think of, from
tea to phonographs, lamps, razors, music boxes,
magic lanterns, bedsteads, cottons, silks, cloths,
chairs, glass-ware, clocks, watches, and I do not
know what else. I believe that it was the largest
caravan of that kind that had ever come over to
Persia from Beluchistan.</p>

<p>After a pleasant interview of an hour or so,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-133" id="Pg_2-133"></a>[<a href="./images/2-133.png">133</a>]</span>
and what humble refreshments I could offer,
they were compelled to continue their journey to
the north. The kittens, having anxiously watched
the departure of Mr. Clemenson's dogs, leapt
back from rock to rock and down on to my
carpet, all three sitting as usual in a row in
front of my plate while I was having my
dinner, with their greedy eyes on the meat, and
occasionally also one of their paws.</p>

<p>We did not make a start till 2.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, when
there was moonlight, as the way was very bad
among stones and boulders. For a short distance
we travelled between high cliffs and boulders,
then between low hills much further apart. On
our left we came to a most peculiar formation of
rock which seemed almost like a castle, and from
this point we got into a long and wide plain,
most uninteresting and swarming with a troublesome
kind of small fly.</p>

<p>A rugged mountain to the north, being higher
and more vividly coloured than the rest, attracted
the eye, as one tried hard to find something to
admire in the scenery; and to the south-west we
saw the back view of the flat-topped plateau
we had skirted the day before. To the S.S.W.
lay another flat-topped high mountain like the
section of a cone which we had noticed on our
previous march.</p>

<p>We were now marching due east, and after
some sixteen miles' journey from our last camp
we again entered a hilly portion of country.
We made a halt of three hours, from 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to
11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, to have our breakfast. Then we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-134" id="Pg_2-134"></a>[<a href="./images/2-134.png">134</a>]</span>
entered the hills by one of the usual dry
channels formed by the water washing down
with great force in rainy weather from the hillsides.
After half a mile we emerged again into
another plain, three miles long and about equally
wide, with very broken, low rocky mountains to
the east, and low sand hills to the south. To the
south-east, in the direction we were following,
stood a massive-looking mountain, which, however,
possessed no very beautiful lines.</p>

<p>More interesting and quaint was the circular
crater in a conical mountain to the north-east of
the long dreary plain we were now traversing.
The mouth of this large crater was much lower
on the south-west side than on the north-east,
thus exposing to the full view of the traveller
the entire opening in the centre of the mountain,
reddish-brown in colour.</p>

<p>Having gone some twelve miles more, we
stopped, at four in the afternoon, in a bitterly
penetrating cold wind, which seemed to have
a most uncomfortable effect upon one's nervous
system. Whether it was that the intense dryness
caused an excess of electricity, or what, I do
not know, but one ached all over in a frightful
manner, and experienced the same tendon-contracting
feeling as when exposed to an electric
current.</p>

<p>One farsakh before reaching camp we had
passed the camping ground of Angiloh, where a
tiny drip of fresh water exists. We happily
found here a quantity of wood, abandoned by
the Clemenson caravan, which we put on our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-135" id="Pg_2-135"></a>[<a href="./images/2-135.png">135</a>]</span>
camels and carried further down into the plain,
where, having found a depression in the ground
affording some shelter from the fearful wind, we
halted to wait until the moon rose.</p>

<p>My fever seized me violently on that night,
and I experienced intense pain in my spine, my
legs and arms, more especially in places where I
had received wounds on previous journeys.</p>

<p>We left again in the middle of the night at
3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and a great effort it was, too, to get out
of one's warm blankets and scramble on the camel,
aching as I was all over, and with the indescribable
exhaustion that fever of the desert brings
on. Luckily, with the rising of the moon, the
wind had somewhat abated, but the electricity in
the air was as unpleasant as it was extraordinary.
One was absolutely saturated with it, and discharged
sparks from one's finger-tips when one
touched anything that was a good conductor.</p>

<p>In the morning at the foot of the mountains
we passed a large fortress where, they told me,
twenty soldiers had been stationed the previous
year in order to suppress brigandage that had
been rampant here. Both Afghan and Sistan
robbers seemed to be most partial to this spot,
probably because it is that at which all the
caravans from Birjand and Meshed converge on
their way to Sistan.</p>

<p>We actually perceived some trees in the distance,
and at last we arrived at Zemahlabad, a
quadrangular fort, with two such peculiar structures
at the sides that I really could not at first
guess what they were. Sadek, called upon to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-136" id="Pg_2-136"></a>[<a href="./images/2-136.png">136</a>]</span>
explain, was no wiser, and we had to find a
solution to our speculation from one of the local
authorities. They were windmills, and most ingenious
and simple they were, too, when once
one had grasped the mechanism of them. Only
in their case the large opening to the east and
west, to let in and out the wind, had been
screened with elaborate wood-work, and it was
not easy to understand the principle of the device
until one visited the interior. We shall come
later in our journey to some quite superior ones,
which I will endeavour to describe.</p>

<p>There were many palm trees at this place and
some few patches of vegetation. A great many
mat-sheds had been erected, and hundreds of
cows were to be seen; the land, being marshy,
provided fair pasturages. (Altitude 2,700 ft.)</p>

<p>To the extreme east of the long valley we
had traversed the Bandan mountains, converged
into an acute angle with those on the opposite
side of the valley, and on the north-east side we
had again the same formation of rock in horizontal
strata with some contortions at its western
end. A salt stream flowed here through a narrow
gorge, between the picturesque, wall-like barrier
to the north and the handsome hills to the
south-west. A great number of palm trees gave
quite a tropical appearance to this gorge, although
the whitish sand mixed with salt impressed one
like dirty snow, and the sky was also whitish and
promising real snow. It was none too hot&mdash;thermometer
34&deg;.</p>

<p>Just before reaching Bandan&mdash;also called Dar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-137" id="Pg_2-137"></a>[<a href="./images/2-137.png">137</a>]</span>ban
by some natives (2,870 ft.)&mdash;we noticed on
the precipitous slopes of the mountain to the
south-west several buildings in ruins, said to be
ancient tombs. They were domed. At the
foot of the mountain were the remains of a
village.</p>

<p>Bandan consisted of a quadrangular walled
village with five high towers and two more
partly collapsed. The lower part of the village
wall&mdash;a regular fortress&mdash;was of stone and mud,
the upper portion of sun-dried mud bricks. It
appeared to have been built at different epochs,
the south-west half especially seeming more
modern than the north-east portion. Holes
about three feet above the ground in the wall
served the purpose of windows to the houses
adjoining the wall inside the castle, and a stone
of suitable size shoved into the aperture was the
shutter.</p>

<p>The village wall had two entrances on the
south-east side, where outside the wall could be
seen fifteen small domed ovens, of the usual
Persian type, for baking bread, the paste of
which is plastered on the inside of the dome
when sufficiently heated.</p>

<p>The highest tower was on the south-west side,
and all of these structures had a foundation of
stone, but the remainder was of mud.</p>

<p>We saw here a string of picturesque women.
They were carrying loads of wood and heavy
bags of wheat on their heads. On perceiving
me unexpectedly they tried to run away, and
did so, but not before I had got the good snap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-138" id="Pg_2-138"></a>[<a href="./images/2-138.png">138</a>]</span>shot
of them here reproduced. It can be seen
by this photograph what long steps these women
took, and how those that carried heavier loads
swung their arms about to diminish the effort
and balance themselves. They walked with a
good deal of spring in their knees.</p>

<p>These women had much stronger features
than the Persian generally have, and resembled&mdash;in
fact, were practically&mdash;Afghan women. One
or two only had the Hindoo type, with large,
soft, drooping eyes, large hook noses, and over-developed
lips, with small receding chins. The
younger ones were strikingly handsome.</p>

<p>On our last march we had come from north
to south, but now, after a short halt, we went on
towards the south-east on what we thought would
be our last two marches before reaching Sher-i-Nasrya,
the capital city of Sistan, only some sixty
miles off. Soon after leaving Bandan we found
ourselves in an open plain with gradually
vanishing mountains to the south-west. To the
north-east the wall-like barrier, about one mile
from Bandan, suddenly ceased in a gentle slope.
East and E.S.E., now that the plain became of
immense breadth, one could see two isolated low
hill ranges, barring which, in the arc of a circle
between north-east and south, we had nothing
before us except a flat, dreary stretch of sand and
stones meeting the sky on the horizon line.</p>

<p>On getting nearer the Hamun-i-Halmund
(swamp), formed by the Halmund river and
others losing themselves into the sand and
flooding part of that region, the whole country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-139" id="Pg_2-139"></a>[<a href="./images/2-139.png">139</a>]</span>
was covered with high reeds and small water
channels, which constantly made us deviate from
our course. In the middle of the night we got
so mixed up that we were unable to go on. It
is most dangerous to make camels get into water
channels, especially if muddy, without being
certain of their depth. The brutes, if sinking,
are seized with panic and collapse, or, in trying
to get out quickly, often slip sideways and get
split in two, which necessitates their being
killed.</p>

<p>In the morning we passed two Cossacks from
the Sistan Consulate escort, who, having been
relieved, were now on their way back to Russia.
They gave us a hearty greeting, and shortly after
a messenger from the British Consul in Sistan
handed me a letter, a most kind invitation from
Major Benn to go and stay with him at the
Consulate.</p>

<p>Towards noon we reached Nasirabad (altitude
2,050 ft.), a very old village founded by one
Malik Nasir Khan Kayani&mdash;the <i>Kayani</i>, as is
well known, being the former rulers of Sistan,
and every big <i>Kayani</i> being called "Malik."
We stopped for a couple of hours for lunch, the
principal house in the village being vacated by
the courteous inmates for my use. The arrival
of a <i>ferenghi</i> excited considerable attention, and
numerous and anxious inquiries were made
whether I was a "Ruski" or "Inglis." On
learning that I was "Inglis," they expressed
their unsolicited conviction that all Inglis were
good people and Ruski all bad, and no doubt if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-140" id="Pg_2-140"></a>[<a href="./images/2-140.png">140</a>]</span>
I had been a Ruski the reverse conviction would
have been expressed with similar eagerness.</p>

<p>The natives were polite, but extremely noisy,
shouting and yelling at the top of their voices
when they spoke. The men wore large white
turbans over their white skull caps, long blue
shirts, opened and buttoned on the left side,
reaching to below their knees, and the enormous
Afghan trousers.</p>

<p>From Nasirabad we came across a long uninterrupted
row of ruined villages and towns,
stretching in a line for some eight miles from
north to south. The most northern one had
the appearance of a fortress with a very high
wall, still in fair preservation, and several more
of these fortresses were to be seen along the
line of houses, the majority of dwellings being
outside these forts. The domed houses&mdash;some
of which were in perfect preservation&mdash;showed
the identical architecture and characteristics of
Persian houses of to-day.</p>

<p>We were benighted again. Curiously enough,
even within a mile or so from Sher-i-Nasrya,
on asking some natives where the city of <i>Nasirabad</i>
or <i>Nasratabad</i>, as it is marked in capital
letters on English maps (even those of the
Indian Trigonometrical Survey), nobody could
tell me, and everybody protested that no such
city existed. (The real name of it, Sher-i-Nasrya,
of course, I only learnt later.)</p>

<p>This was puzzling, but not astonishing, for
there is a deal of fancy nomenclature on English
maps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-141" id="Pg_2-141"></a>[<a href="./images/2-141.png">141</a>]</span></p>

<p>Eventually, when I had almost despaired of
reaching the place that night, although I could
not have been more than a stone-throw from
it, I appealed to another passer-by, riding briskly
on a donkey.</p>

<p>"How far are we from Nasratabad?"</p>

<p>"Never heard the name."</p>

<p>"Is there a town here called Nasirabad?"</p>

<p>"No, there is no such town&mdash;but you must
have come through a small village by that name,
two farsakhs off."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. Do you happen to know
where the English Consulate is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, everybody knows the English
Consulate. I will take you there. It is only
a short distance from here, near the city of
Sher-i-Nasrya!"</p>

<p>Thanks to this fellow, a few minutes later
I found myself greeted most effusively by
Major and Mrs. Benn in their charming mud
Consulate. This was on the evening of
December 6th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Disappointing</span> as it may seem that the natives
themselves should be barefaced enough not to
call their city by the fancy name given it by
certain British geographers, we might as well
explain why the natives call the capital of Sistan
by its real name, Sher-i-Nasrya. The three
words mean the "City of Nasr," Nasr being an
abbreviation of Nasr-ed-din Shah, in honour of
whom the city was named. In Sistan itself the
city goes by the shortened name of mere "Sher"
or "city," but letters sent by Persians from other
parts of the Shah's dominions are generally
addressed Sher-i-Nasrya, or simply Sher-i-Sistan.</p>

<p>When the place was first conquered by the
father of the present Amir, Mir-Alam-Khan, it
was spoken of as Nusratabad, or the "City or
Victory," just the same as we speak of the "City
of the Commune," or the "Eternal City," or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-143" id="Pg_2-143"></a>[<a href="./images/2-143.png">143</a>]</span>
"City of Fogs." The name "Nusratabad"
only applied to the victory and not to the city.
We should certainly not wish to see the names
of the three above illustrations given on maps
for Paris, Rome, or London.</p>

<p>As for calling the city Nasirabad, as the
Trigonometrical Survey maps do, there is no
excuse whatever for this, which is a mere
blunder&mdash;not the only one, unfortunately&mdash;and
attributes to the city the name of a small village
some eight miles off.</p>

<p>The present Sher-i-Nasrya is not more than
twenty years old. It has a double wall all
round, a higher one with semicircular castellated
towers, and a lower on a mud bank with
outwardly projecting semicircular protected
platforms, the walls of which, eight feet high,
are loopholed in a primitive fashion. On the
inner side of the lower wall there is a platform
all along the wall for soldiers to stand upon.
The city wall, forty feet high, is separated from
this outer defence by a road all round the city,
and outside of all there is a moat, but with very
little water in it.</p>

<p>The wall on the south side (really S.S.W.)
has ten towers, the two central ones being close
together and larger than the others, between
which is the principal city gate, reached by an
earthen bridge and a tortuous way, as the
entrance of the outer wall is not in a line with
the inner. The east and west side have only
eight towers, including the corner ones, the
double towers being the fourth and fifth. Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-144" id="Pg_2-144"></a>[<a href="./images/2-144.png">144</a>]</span>
tower is semicircular, with loopholes pointing
towards the sky&mdash;very useful in case of defence&mdash;and
a large opening for pieces of artillery.
The corner towers have two of these apertures,
one under the other.</p>

<p>A kind of bastion or battlement has been
formed by piling up the earth removed from the
moat round the lower wall. The moat is forty
feet broad and thirty feet deep.</p>

<p>A large road was made not long ago round
three sides of the city by Colonel Trench, then
our Consul there, so that the Amir could drive
to his garden, a quarter of a mile outside the
north city gate, the residence of the Amir's son,
the Sar-tip. On the west side of Sher-i-Nasrya
there is merely a sheep track.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-026.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-026_th.jpg" alt="The Main Street, Sher-i-Nasrya. (Showing centre of City.)" title="The Main Street, Sher-i-Nasrya. (Showing centre of City.)" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The Main Street, Sher-i-Nasrya.</span> (Showing centre of City.)</p>

<p>In the north-west corner of the city is a
higher wall enclosing a large space and forming
the citadel and Anderun, in which the Amir and
part of his family reside. There are three large
towers to each side of the quadrangle, the centre
tower to the south being of much larger proportions
than the others. A lower outer wall
surrounds the higher one, and in the large
tower is the entrance gate to the Governor's
citadel.</p>

<p>The inside of the city of Sher-i-Nasrya is
neither beautiful nor interesting from a pictorial
point of view. There is a main street with some
mud buildings standing up, others tumbled down.
The full-page illustration shows the most attractive
and interesting point of the city, the
centre of the quadrangle where the two streets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-145" id="Pg_2-145"></a>[<a href="./images/2-145.png">145</a>]</span>
one from south to north, the other from east to
west, intersect at right angles. A dome of mud
bricks has been erected over the street, and under
its shade a number of the Amir's soldiers were
generally to be seen with their rifles resting idle
against the wall.</p>

<p>The type of Sistan residence can be seen in
the two hovels to the right of the observer in
this photograph. The two hoods on the highest
point of the dome are two typical ventilators.
To the left the large doorways are mere shops,
with a kind of narrow verandah on which the
purchasers squat when buying goods. The main
street is very narrow and has a small platform
almost all along its sides, on which the natives sit
smoking their kalians or conversing.</p>

<p>I was really very much impressed, each time
that I visited the city in the Consul's company,
by the intense respect shown by these people to
our representative. There was not a single man
who did not rise and salaam when we rode
through the bazaar, while many also came forward
to seize the Consul's hand and pay him the
customary compliments. Major Benn modestly
put down this civility of the natives to the
popularity of his predecessor, Major Trench, and
the good manners which he had taught these
men; but Major Benn himself, with his most
affable manner, his unsophisticated ways, absolutely
devoid of nonsensical red-tape or false
pride, is to my mind also to be held responsible
for the reverence which he inspires among the
masses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-146" id="Pg_2-146"></a>[<a href="./images/2-146.png">146</a>]</span></p>

<p>To me personally, I must confess, it was a
very great pleasure indeed to see an English
gentleman held in such respect, and that solely
on account of his tact and <i>savoir faire</i>. It is not
a common sight.</p>

<p>Of course, a certain amount of show has also
to be made to impress the natives, but "show"
alone, as some believe, will be of little good
unless there is something more attractive behind
it. Major Benn seemed to be everybody's
welcomed friend; everybody, whether rich or
poor, whether in smart clothes or rags, gleamed
with delight as they saw him come; and Major
Benn stopped his horse, now to say a kind word
to a merchant, then to shake hands with a
native friend, further on to talk to a little child
who had run to the door of his parents' mud hut
to say "salameleko" to the Consul.</p>

<p>It is men with sound common sense, civil
manners, and human sympathy, of Benn's type,
that we want to represent England everywhere,
and these men, as I have ever maintained, can
do Great Britain more good in foreign countries
in a day than all the official red-tape in a year.
It is a mistake to believe that Persians or other
Asiatics are only impressed by gold braiding and
by a large retinue of servants. The natives have
a wonderful intuitive way of correctly gauging
people, as we civilised folk do not seem able to
do, and it is the man himself, and his doings,
that they judge and criticise, and not so much
the amount of gold braiding on a man's coat or
trousers, or the cut of a resplendent uniform.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-147" id="Pg_2-147"></a>[<a href="./images/2-147.png">147</a>]</span></p>

<p>In the northern portion of the main street are
the few shops with English and Russian goods.
Most of the articles I saw in the couple of Indian
shops were of Indian or English importation&mdash;many
of the articles appeared to me of German
manufacture, like the usual cheap goods one
sees in the Indian bazaars.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the road was the rival
merchant who dealt in Russian goods, and he
seemed to be doing quite a brisk business. He
appeared to deal mostly in clothes. There is a
kind of moleskin Russian cloth called the <i>shikin
maghut</i>, of various shades, colours and qualities,
which commands a ready sale both in Khorassan
and Sistan, although its price is high and its
quality and dye not particularly good. With
a little enterprise Indian manufacturers could
certainly make a similar and better cloth and
easily undersell the Russian material.</p>

<p>It is most satisfactory to find from Captain
Webb-Ware's statement that Indian trade by the
Nushki-Sistan route, which was absolutely nil in
the year 1895-96, and only amounted to some
64,000 rupees in 1896-97, made a sudden
jump to 589,929 rupees in the following twelve
months, 1897-98. It has since been steadily on
the increase, as can be seen by the following
figures:&mdash;</p>

<div class='centered'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Indian trade via the Nushki-Sistan route">
<tr><td align='left'>1898-99</td><td align='center'>Rupees</td><td align='right'>728,082</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>1899-1900</td><td align='center'>"</td><td align='right'>1,235,411</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>1900-01</td><td align='center'>"</td><td align='right'>1,534,452</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>These figures are the total amount of imports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-148" id="Pg_2-148"></a>[<a href="./images/2-148.png">148</a>]</span>
and exports by the Nushki route, beginning
from 1st of April each year. In 1900-01
the imports were Rs. 748,021; the exports
Rs. 786,431.</p>

<p>When the route comes to be better known
the returns will inevitably be greatly increased,
but of course only a railway&mdash;or a well-conducted
service of motor vans&mdash;can make this route a
really practical one for trade on a large scale.
The cost of transport at present is too great.</p>

<p>A point which should be noted in connection
with the railway is that every year a great
number of horses are brought from Meshed to
India <i>via</i> Quetta for remount purposes. In
1900-01 the number of horses brought by
dealers to Quetta amounted to 408, and as the
Khorassan horses are most excellent, they were
promptly sold at very remunerative prices. The
average price for a capital horse in Persia is from
80 to 100 rupees (15 rupees to &pound;1). I understand
that these horses when in Quetta are sold
by dealers to Government at an average of 300
rupees each, leaving a very large profit indeed.
As horses are very plentiful in Khorassan, if
a railway existed the Government could remount
its cavalry at one-third of the present cost.</p>

<p>Adjoining Sher-i-Nasrya to the south is the
partly ruined village of Husseinabad. It has a
wall, now collapsed, and a moat which forms an
obtuse angle with the east wall of Sher-i-Nasrya.
There are in this village some miserable little
mud houses still standing up and inhabited, and
the high-walled, gloomy mud building of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-149" id="Pg_2-149"></a>[<a href="./images/2-149.png">149</a>]</span>
Russian Vice-Consulate which has lately been
erected, opposite to an extensive graveyard.</p>

<p>The site and the outward appearance of the
Russian Vice-Consulate, which one can only
reach by jumping over various drain channels
or treading over graves, was decidedly not one's
ideal spot for a residence, but once inside the
dwelling, both house and host were really charming.
Mr. Miller, the Consul, was a very intelligent
and able man indeed, a most wonderful
linguist, and undoubtedly a very efficient officer
for his country. There is also in Husseinabad a
round tower where the Beluch Sirdar fought the
Amir some nine years ago, and one or two windmills
characteristic of Sistan and Beluchistan.</p>

<p>These windmills are not worked by sails in a
vertical position like ours, but are indeed the
simplest and most ingenious contrivance of its
kind I have ever seen. The motive wheel, which
revolves in a horizontal position, is encased in
high walls on three sides, leaving a slit on the
north side, from whence the prevalent winds of
Sistan blow. The wind entering with great force
by this vertical slit&mdash;the walls being so cut as to
catch as much wind as possible&mdash;sets the wheel
in motion&mdash;a wheel which, although made
coarsely of reeds tied in six bundles fastened
together by means of cross-arms of wood, revolves
easily on a long iron pivot, and once set
in motion attains a high speed.</p>

<p>The flour mill has two stories, the motive
wheel occupying the entire second floor, while
attached to its pivot on the ground floor is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-150" id="Pg_2-150"></a>[<a href="./images/2-150.png">150</a>]</span>
actual grinding stone. The wheat to be ground
flows into a central aperture in this stone from a
suspended vessel, a simple system of strings and
ropes acting as an efficient brake on the axle of
the upper wheel to control its speed, and others
allowing the grain to fall uniformly and, when
necessary, preventing its flow.</p>

<p class="illc">The British Bazar (Husseinabad) Sistan.</p>

<p>There sweeps over Sistan in the hot weather
what is called the <i>Bad-i-sud-o-bist-roz</i>, or wind of
the 120 days, which blows from the north-north-west,
and, although this may seem unpleasant to
the inhabitants, it has a most undoubtedly
salubrious effect upon the climate of the province,
which, owing to the great quantity of channels
and stagnant water, would otherwise be most unhealthy.
As it is the climate is now extremely
healthy. The water of the Halmund is delicious
to drink.</p>

<p>The suburb of Husseinabad stretches for about
one mile towards the south, and contains among
other places of importance the buildings of the
Customs, with a caravanserai&mdash;very modest and
unsafe&mdash;a picture of which is here given. What
is called "Benn Bazaar," or the British Bazaar, is
also found at the south-east portion of Husseinabad
and facing the Consulate Hospital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> entire British bazaar&mdash;a modest one so
far&mdash;can be taken in at a glance. The snapshot
reproduced in the illustration gives a very good
idea of it. Besides this, one or two Indian
British merchants are established in the main
street of Sher-i-Nasrya, where, as we have seen,
they have opened nice shops.</p>

<p>The pioneer merchants of Sistan were the firm
of Mahommed Ali Brothers, of Quetta, established
in 1900, and represented by a very intelligent
man called Seth Suliman.</p>

<p>The firm has branches in Birjand and Meshed.
They have done good business both in Sistan,
Birjand and Meshed, and have been followed in
Sistan by Tek-Chand, of the wealthy firm of
Chaman Singh from Shikarpur&mdash;at one time
the trade-centre of Asia. This firm holds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-152" id="Pg_2-152"></a>[<a href="./images/2-152.png">152</a>]</span>
to-day the opium contract of the whole of the
Sind district, and is a most enterprising concern.</p>

<p>Mahommed Azim Khan Brothers, of Lahore,
have also opened a shop in Sistan, and so has
Mahommed Hayab, agent for Shek Fars
Mahommed, the biggest British firm in Meshed.
It is probable that in the near future a number
of other Indian firms may be induced to open
branches in Sistan and Khorassan; but, if they are
to avoid disappointment, they should remember
that the Sistan market is merely a retail
one, and there is very little wholesale trade to be
transacted so far. In time to come no doubt a
wholesale trade will eventually be developed.</p>

<p>A point which is seldom grasped, or at any
rate is frequently overlooked, is that Sistan
(Sher-i-Nasrya) is a mere half-way house
between Quetta and Meshed, and not, as is
supposed by many people, the terminus of the
route. Considerable loss and disappointment
have been sustained by some rash British traders,
who, notwithstanding the exceptional opportunities
given them to obtain accurate official
information, set out with large caravans, apparently
without the most rudimentary geographical
knowledge, as well as without sound
commercial foresight.</p>

<p>Another mistake is frequent. Somehow or
other the idea seems to prevail among some
Indian traders that Persia, or Eastern Persia,
forms part of the Indian Empire, and they forget
that the protection and unusual facilities which
they enjoy from Quetta to Robat (the Beluch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-153" id="Pg_2-153"></a>[<a href="./images/2-153.png">153</a>]</span>
frontier) and, to a certain extent, as far as
Sistan, cannot possibly be given on Persian
territory beyond Sistan as far as Meshed.</p>

<p>Although practically across a desert, the
journey from Quetta-Nushki to Sistan is&mdash;for
travelling of that kind&mdash;extremely comfortable
and easy; the real difficulty begins for traders
when they are perforce left to look after themselves
on Persian soil, where there are no more
clean rest-houses and where a Britisher&mdash;if travelling
as a trader&mdash;is no more thought of than if
he were an Asiatic trader. He is no longer
the salaamed "Sahib" of the Indian cities, but
becomes a mere <i>ferenghi</i>, a stranger, and is at the
mercy of everybody.</p>

<p>Moreover, it should be well understood that
the protection and redress obtainable under
English law, cease on crossing the Persian
frontier. Very little, if any, redress is to be
obtained from Persian officials except at great
cost and infinite worry, waste of time and
patience.</p>

<p>Indian tea traders have probably been the
greatest sufferers in consequence of their rash
ventures, and they will probably suffer even
more in the future if they do not exercise
greater caution in ascertaining beforehand the
suitable markets for their teas and the actual
cost of transport to the markets selected. Several
traders have brought very large caravans of
Indian tea to Sistan on various occasions,
believing that they had arrived at the end of
their journey, and, after having paid the heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-154" id="Pg_2-154"></a>[<a href="./images/2-154.png">154</a>]</span>
duty imposed upon goods introduced into the
country, have found before them the option of
going the 600 miles back to Quetta or continuing
at great expense, <i>via</i> Bam to Kerman, a long
journey with doubtful results at the end; or of
going to Birjand, Meshed, Teheran, where they
have eventually been compelled to sell at a loss
or to pay the additional Russian duty and send
the tea on to Moscow.</p>

<p>The Persian market is at present very much
blocked up with Indian teas, and great caution
should be exercised by intending exporters from
India. In time to come, when good roads have
been made in every direction, or railways constructed,
and cost of transport greatly minimised,
Persia will be, I think, a considerable buyer
of Indian teas; but as matters are to-day the
expense of conveying the tea to the various
Persian markets, especially by the land route, is
too great to make any profit possible at the very
low prices paid by the Persians for tea.</p>

<p>Tea exported overland to the Meshed market
(not to Sistan) realised, before the market became
overstocked, better prices than the sea-borne tea
<i>via</i> Bandar Abbas. It is certain that the delicate
aroma of tea is not improved by being exposed to
the warm sea air, no matter how carefully it has
been packed. And as Major Webb-Ware, the
political agent at Chagai, points out, tea despatched
by the land route direct from the
gardens or from Calcutta is not liable to the
numerous incidental charges, commissions and
transhipments which are a matter of course upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-155" id="Pg_2-155"></a>[<a href="./images/2-155.png">155</a>]</span>
teas sent <i>via</i> Bandar Abbas or other Persian Gulf
ports.</p>

<p>The demand for unspoiled teas brought overland
is considerable in Russia and all over
Europe, even more than in Persia, and when a
sensible understanding has been arrived at with
Russia to let Indian teas proceed in transit
through that country, there is no reason why the
better Indian teas should not favourably compete
all over Europe with the China caravan teas.</p>

<p>The Persian market, to my mind, speaking
generally, will only be able to purchase the
inferior teas, the Persians as individuals being
comparatively poor. Superior teas in small
quantities, however, may find a sale at good
prices among the official classes and the few
richer folks, but not in sufficient quantities to
guarantee a large import. The same remarks, I
think, would apply to teas finding their way into
Western Afghanistan from various points on the
Sistan-Meshed route.</p>

<p>The Indian tea-traders have shown very commendable
enterprise in attempting to push their
teas by the overland route, and trying to exploit
the new markets which the Nushki-Meshed
route has thrown open to them, but their beginning
has been made too suddenly and on too
large a scale, which I fear will cause a temporary
loss to some of them. A gradual, steady development
of the tea trade is wanted in Persia,
not a rush and violent competition flooding the
market with tea that has to be sold at a loss.
When the natives all over Persia have by degrees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-156" id="Pg_2-156"></a>[<a href="./images/2-156.png">156</a>]</span>
got accustomed to Indian tea, and when it is
brought in at a cheap price, Indian teas are likely
to be popular in Persia.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-028.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-028_th.jpg" alt="The Wall of Sher-i-Nasrya at Sunset." title="The Wall of Sher-i-Nasrya at Sunset." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Wall of Sher-i-Nasrya at Sunset.</p>

<p>I may be wrong, but, to my mind, the greater
profits on Indian teas brought by this route will
in the future be made not in Persia itself, but
in Transcaspia, Turkestan, Russia and Central
Europe, where people can pay well for a good
article. Great credit should be given to the
Indian and Dehra Dun Tea Associations for
despatching representatives to study the requirements
of the Persian market on the spot; but, as
Captain Webb-Ware suggests in the <i>Gazette of
India</i>, the tea associations would do well to turn
their attention to the sale of Indian teas in Russia,
and to send some experimental consignments of
their teas to Moscow by the overland route.
The same remarks might also apply to a great
many other English or Indian manufactured
goods.</p>

<p>We complain a great deal that the Russian
protective tariff is high, but it is mild when
compared with the murderous protectionism of
the United States or of our beloved friend
Germany. And, after all, does this protection
keep out our goods from those countries? By
no means. Russia's industries are indeed fast
developing, but they are far from sufficient to
supply her own wants. English, German, and
American goods find their way even to the most
remote spots of Siberia. It is, then, a problem
worth considering whether "free trade Persia,"
with her English and Indian imports amounting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-157" id="Pg_2-157"></a>[<a href="./images/2-157.png">157</a>]</span>
to one million four hundred thousand pounds
sterling (&pound;1,400,000), is a customer so well
worth cultivating as protectionist Russia, which
buys from us nearly twenty-two millions'
(&pound;21,974,952) worth yearly.</p>

<p>In regard to the Quetta-Meshed route, it would
strike a casual observer that from our geographical
situation we might, without much difficulty, kill
two birds with one stone by a happy combination&mdash;Persia
being dealt with <i>en passant</i>, as it were,
while aiming for quicker, sounder, and more
extensive markets further north.</p>

<p>Persia is a good market for Indian indigo,
which has, so far, commanded a ready sale.</p>

<p>In Sistan itself&mdash;which, it cannot be too emphatically
repeated, is to-day only a comparatively
poor and sparsely-populated district&mdash;the
articles which have, so far, found a quick retail
sale, have been Indian assorted spices, second-hand
apparel, sugar, tea, boots, cheap cotton cloths,
matches, kerosene oil, thread, needles, cheap
cutlery, scissors, small looking glasses.</p>

<p>The Amir and the Sardars have at different
times made purchases of boots, shoes, saddlery,
silk, woollen and cotton cloths, rugs, shawls,
crockery, and enamel ware, watches, chains, and
knives, and have also bought a considerable
number of English-made fancy goods, furniture,
stationery, cigarettes, cigars and tobacco,
&amp;c. The humbler Sistanis purchase very freely
from the Indian British shops, but cannot afford
to pay very high prices; but the high officials
pay cash and give a good price for all they buy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-158" id="Pg_2-158"></a>[<a href="./images/2-158.png">158</a>]</span></p>

<p>Speaking generally, the articles which are
mostly wanted at present are those mentioned in
the official report. For these commodities there
is a steady demand in the markets of Sistan and
Khorassan, but the supply, it should be remembered,
should be in proportion to the size of the
population. Sistan, Birjand, Meshed, are not
London nor Paris nor Berlin.</p>

<p>The articles wanted are:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Woollen stuffs, flannels, muslins, mulls, sheetings, chintzes, cottons, &amp;c.</li>
<li>Velvets, satins, silks, brocades.</li>
<li>Indigo of medium and good quality. (Oudh indigo is principally in demand in Bushire.)</li>
<li>Iron, brass and copper sheets.</li>
<li>Sulphur matches.</li>
<li>Spices, including cinnamon, cardamums, cloves, pepper, turmeric, &amp;c.</li>
<li>Rice (for Sistan).</li>
<li>Tea, black for Persia, and green for Afghanistan and Transcaspia.</li>
<li>Coffee (in berry).</li>
<li>Refined sugar, loaf.</li>
<li>Ginger preserve (in jars).</li>
<li>Sal-ammoniac.</li>
<li>Baizes (specially of high class), Khinkhabs and gold cloth.</li>
<li>Cotton turbans (lungis) of all qualities, including those with pure gold fringes.</li>
<li>Leather goods.</li>
<li>Boots (Cawnpore and English).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-159" id="Pg_2-159"></a>[<a href="./images/2-159.png">159</a>]</span></li>
<li>Saddlery (Cawnpore, as the English is too expensive).</li>
<li>Glass-ware.</li>
<li>Enamel-ware.</li>
<li>Cutlery.</li>
<li>Ironmongery of every description. Cheap padlocks find a ready sale.</li>
<li>Watches (cheap).</li>
<li>Jewellery.</li>
<li>Kalai (for tinning copper vessels).</li>
</ul>

<p>Fire-arms would command a very ready sale,
but their importation is strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>The articles of export from Khorassan and
Sistan are wool, ghi, saffron, dried fruit of
various kinds, hides, jujubes, assafoetida, pistachio-nuts,
barak, kurak, gum, valuable carpets,
and some turquoises.</p>

<p>In Sistan itself wheat and oats are plentiful,
but their export to foreign countries is not
permitted. Opium finds its way out of the
country <i>via</i> Bandar Abbas, and wool, ghi,
feathers, carpets, and assafoetida are conveyed
principally to Kerman, Birjand, Meshed, Yezd,
the Gulf, and Quetta.</p>

<p>One of the principal problems of the new
land route to India is not only how to induce
British traders to go to Persia, but how to solve
the more difficult point of persuading the big
Persian traders to cross the bridge and venture
into India. They seem at present too indolent
and suspicious to undertake such a long journey,
and would rather pay for luxuries to be brought
to their doors than go and get them themselves.</p>

<p>With the assistance, both moral and financial,
of the enterprising Major Sykes, a large caravan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-160" id="Pg_2-160"></a>[<a href="./images/2-160.png">160</a>]</span>
was sent from Kerman to Quetta with Persian
goods, and paid satisfactorily, but others that
followed seem to have had a good many
disasters on the road (on Persian territory) and
fared less well. Major Sykes's effort was most
praiseworthy, for indeed, as regards purely
Persian trade, I think Kerman or Yezd must
in future be the aiming points of British
caravans rather than Meshed. These places
have comparatively large populations and the
field of operations is practically unoccupied,
whereas in Meshed Russian competition is very
strong.</p>

<p>With the present ways of communication
across the Salt Desert, it is most difficult and
costly to attempt remunerative commercial communication
with these towns. Small caravans
could not possibly pay expenses, and large
caravans might fare badly owing to lack of
water, while the circuitous road <i>via</i> Bam is too
expensive.</p>

<p>When more direct tracks, with wells at each
stage, after the style of the Nushki-Sistan route,
have been constructed between Robat and
Kerman, and also between Sher-i-Nasrya and
Kerman, and Sher-i-Nasrya and Yezd, matters
will be immensely facilitated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sistan</span> is in a state of rapid transition, and it
is doubtful whether the position of the three or
four Europeans on duty there is one of perfect
safety. The natives are so far undoubtedly and
absolutely favourable to British influence in preference
to Russian, a state of affairs mainly due
to the personal tact of Majors Trench and Benn
rather than to instructions from home, but great
caution should be exercised in the future if this
prestige, now at its highest point, is to be maintained.</p>

<p>The Russians are advancing very fast, and their
influence is already beginning to be felt in no
slight degree. The Sistanis may or may not be
relied upon. They are not perfectly Europeanised
like peoples of certain parts of Western<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-162" id="Pg_2-162"></a>[<a href="./images/2-162.png">162</a>]</span>
Persia, nor are they quite so amenable to reason
as could be wished. They can easily be led, or
misled, and bribed, and are by no means easy
folks to deal with. For a few tomans one can
have people assassinated, the Afghan frontier so
close at hand being a guarantee of impunity for
murderers, and fights between the townspeople
and the Afghans or Beluch, in which many people
are injured and killed, are not uncommon.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-029.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-029_th.jpg" alt="The Sar-tip." title="The Sar-tip." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Sar-tip.</p>

<p>One of these fights, between Sistanis and
Afghans (under British protection), took place
when I was in Sistan, and I think it is only
right that it should be related, as it proves very
forcibly that, as I have continually urged in this
book, calm and tact, gentleness and fairness, have
a greater and more lasting control over Persians
than outward pomp and red-tape.</p>

<p>The Consul and I, after calling on the Amir,
proceeded to visit the Sar-tip, the Amir's first
son by his legal wife. The Sar-tip is the head
of a force of cavalry, and inhabits a country
house, the Chahar Bagh, in a garden to the north
outside the city. He is a bright and intelligent
youth, who had travelled with Dr. Golam Jelami
to India&mdash;from which country he had recently
returned, and where he had gone to consult
specialists about his sadly-failing eyesight.</p>

<p>The Sar-tip, of whom a portrait is here given,
received us most kindly and detained us till dark.
Being Ramzam-time we then bade him good-bye,
and were riding home when, as we neared
the Consulate gate, a man who seemed much
excited rushed to the Consul and handed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-163" id="Pg_2-163"></a>[<a href="./images/2-163.png">163</a>]</span>
a note from the Belgian Customs officer. As I
was still convalescent&mdash;this was my first outing&mdash;and
not allowed out after dusk, Major Benn
asked me to go back to the Consulate as he was
called to the Customs caravanserai on business.
I suspected nothing until a messenger came to
the Consulate with news. A crowd of some 300
Sistanis had attacked some fifteen Afghan camel
men, who had come over with a caravan of tea
from Quetta. These camel drivers had been
paid several thousand rupees for their services on
being dismissed, and some money quarrel had
arisen.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the Consul the fight was in
full swing, and he found a crowd of howling
Sistanis throwing stones and bricks at the
Afghans. At Major Benn's appearance, notwithstanding
that their blood was up and their
temper, one would think, beyond control, the
Sistanis immediately opened a way for him, some
even temporarily stopping fighting to make a
courteous salaam. This will show in what respect
our Consul is held.</p>

<p>The Afghans, having by this time realised
that they had been insulted, and having,
furthermore, discovered the loss of some money&mdash;which
they only detected when they went
for their rifles and swords, which they kept
together in a safe place with their treasure&mdash;formed
up in line and, with drawn swords, made
a rush on the Sistanis.</p>

<p>Major Benn with considerable pluck dashed
between the fighting men, seizing with his left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-164" id="Pg_2-164"></a>[<a href="./images/2-164.png">164</a>]</span>
hand the rifle of the leader&mdash;who had knelt down
and was on the point of firing&mdash;and with his
right hand got hold of the blade&mdash;fortunately
blunt&mdash;of another Afghan's sword, who was
slashing away at the Sistanis near him. The
force of the blow caused quite a wound in the
gallant Major's hand, but suddenly, as by magic
owing to the respect he commanded on both
sides, his action put a stop to the fight.</p>

<p>Seizing this opportunity he talked to them
calmly in his usual quiet, jocular manner, and
told the Afghans how, by behaving in this
fashion, while under his protection, they were
doing him harm in the eyes of the Persians in
whose country they were guests, and that if they
had any claim they must apply to him and not
take the law into their own hands. With his
keen sense of humour he even succeeded with
some joke or other in raising a laugh from both
belligerent parties, and requested them to sit
down and give up their arms into his custody,
which they willingly did.</p>

<p>The Afghans seated themselves at the further
end of the caravanserai, while the Sistanis, whom
he next addressed in the kindest way, were
persuaded to desist from using further violence.
He managed to turn the whole thing into a joke,
and eventually the Sistanis dispersed laughing
and retired within the wall of their city; but,
indeed, there were five Afghans left on the
ground severely wounded,&mdash;one with a fractured
skull being carried to the Consulate Hospital in
a dying condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-165" id="Pg_2-165"></a>[<a href="./images/2-165.png">165</a>]</span></p>

<p>The Afghans possessed some excellent Russian
rifles, a great many of which find their way into
Afghanistan from the north.</p>

<p>The Consul, when the row was over, proceeded
to the Amir, who had the gates of the city
instantly closed and promised the Consul that
they should not be opened again until the Consul
could go the next day to identify the ringleaders
of the attacking Sistanis. The Amir received
the Consul with more than usually marked
respect, and showed himself greatly disturbed at
the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'occurence'">occurrence</ins>. He took personal charge of the
keys of the city and undertook to mete out severe
punishment upon the offenders.</p>

<p>The city gates, which are daily opened at
sunrise, remained closed the greater portion of
the day at the Consul's request, but for a consideration
the doorkeepers let out occasional citizens,&mdash;in
all probability those very ones that should
have been kept in.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, being Ramzam-time, when
Mussulmans sit up feasting the greater part of
the night, as they are compelled to fast when the
sun is above the horizon, his Excellency the
Amir was unable to attend to even this important
matter, which was left to slide from day to day.
The Consul, however, although extremely patient,
was the last man to let things go to the wall,
and no doubt in the end the leaders were duly
punished and compensation paid.</p>

<p>The illustration shows the Customs caravanserai,
in front of which the fight took place.
Two of the domed rooms shown in the picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-166" id="Pg_2-166"></a>[<a href="./images/2-166.png">166</a>]</span>
are occupied by Mr. Miletor, the Belgian
Customs officer, in Persian employ. The others
are occupied by camel-men or native travellers,
there being no other caravanserai of the kind in
Sher-i-Nasrya.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-030.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-030_th.jpg" alt="The Customs Caravanserai, Sher-i-Nasrya, Sistan. (Belgian Customs Officer in foreground.)" title="The Customs Caravanserai, Sher-i-Nasrya, Sistan. (Belgian Customs Officer in foreground.)" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The Customs Caravanserai, Sher-i-Nasrya, Sistan.</span> (Belgian Customs Officer in foreground.)</p>

<p>It would be a very great addition to the British
Consulate, now that so many Beluch and Afghans,
all under British protection, travel through Sistan,
if a British caravanserai could be built in which
they, their goods and their camels, might enjoy
comparative safety. The expense of putting it
up would be very small, and it would avoid the
constant friction which is bound to exist at
present in a country where honesty is not the
chief forte of the lower people, and where
quarrels are ever rampant. Even during the
short stay of Messrs. Clemenson and Marsh's
caravan, several articles were stolen under their
very eyes in the Consulate shelter, and at the
time of my visit caravans, British or otherwise,
were absolutely at the mercy of the natives.
The goods were left out in the open in front of
the caravanserai, and the Customs people had not
sufficient men to protect them from interference
at the hands of the lower people.</p>

<p>I have seen it stated by correspondents in
leading London papers that "Russian" Customs
officials were stationed in Sistan, and interfered
greatly with British caravans. That is mere
fiction from beginning to end. As I have
already stated, there is not a single Russian in
the Customs anywhere in Persia. In Sistan the
only official&mdash;a Belgian&mdash;far from interfering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-167" id="Pg_2-167"></a>[<a href="./images/2-167.png">167</a>]</span>
with the caravans, is of great help to them and
does all in his power within the limits of his
duty to be of assistance to them. The Consul
himself was full of praise of the extreme fairness
and justice to all alike of the Belgian official.
There never was the slightest trouble or hitch so
long as traders were prepared to comply with
Persian laws, and so long as people paid the
duty on the goods entering the country no bother
of any kind was given to anybody, either
British or others.</p>

<p>On April 3rd, 1901, the Persian Government
introduced a law abolishing all inland Customs
Houses and transit dues, and substituting instead
a <i>rahdari</i> tax of 6 annas per 240 pounds. This
tax is payable on crossing the frontier, and is
levied in addition to the 5 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>
duty to which the Persian Government is entitled
under the existing International Customs Convention.
The rate of duty levied (5 per cent.),
is calculated on the actual value of goods, plus
the cost of transport.</p>

<p>The Sistan Consul, as well as the officials
of the Nushki Sistan route in Beluchistan, go to
an <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'inmmense'">immense</ins> deal of trouble to be of use to
British traders and travellers, and everything is
made as easy for them as is compatible with the
nature of the country and existing laws.</p>

<p>A great deal of extra heavy work was thrown
upon the shoulders of Major Benn, who acted in
no less than three official capacities&mdash;Consul,
Postmaster, and Banker&mdash;as well as, unofficially,
as architect, house-builder, and general reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-168" id="Pg_2-168"></a>[<a href="./images/2-168.png">168</a>]</span>
officer. It is very satisfactory to learn that this
autumn (1902) an assistant is to be sent out to
him from India, for the work seemed indeed too
heavy for one man. Day and night's incessant
work would in time have certainly told on even
the cheerful disposition and abnormally wiry
constitution of Major Benn, who, besides being
a most loyal and careful official, takes a great
deal of personal pride in fighting hard to win the
severe race which will result in our eventually
acquiring or losing Sistan and Eastern Persia
commercially. Major Benn is most decidedly
very far ahead in the race at present, and owing
to him British prestige happens to be at its
zenith, but greater support will be needed in
the future if this advantageous race is to be
continued up to the winning post.</p>

<p>Were a Vice-Consulate established at Birjand,
as I have said before, the Sistan Consular work
would be relieved of much unnecessary strain,
the distance from Birjand to Sistan being too great
under present conditions to allow the Consul to
visit the place even yearly. The medical British
Agent whom we have there at present is excellent,
but the powers at his disposal are small, and a
Consulate with an English officer in charge would
most decidedly enhance British prestige in that
important city, as well as being a useful connecting
link between Sistan and Meshed, a distance of
close upon 500 miles.</p>

<p>It was a most excellent step to select for the
Consular work in Eastern and Southern Persia
men from the Military Political Service, instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-169" id="Pg_2-169"></a>[<a href="./images/2-169.png">169</a>]</span>
of the usual Foreign Office men, who are
probably better adapted for countries already
developed. The Political Service is a most
perfect body of gentlemanly, sensible, active-minded,
well-educated men of versatile talents,
the pick of the healthiest and cleverest Englishmen
in our Indian Service. They cannot help
doing good wherever they are sent. Captain
Trench, Major Benn, Major Phillott, Captain
White, have all answered perfectly, and have
all done and are doing excellent work.</p>

<p>What is most needed at present in Sistan is a
telegraph line to Nushki. Should everybody in
the Sistan Consulate be murdered, it would be
the best part of a fortnight or three weeks
before the news could reach India at the
present rate of post going. If assistance were
needed it could not reach Sistan from Quetta in
less than a couple of months, by which time, I
think, it would be of little use to those in danger.
And the danger, mind you, does exist. It seems
rather hard that we should leave men who work,
and work hard and well, for their country absolutely
at the mercy of destiny.</p>

<p>The next most important point would be to
join Sistan, or at least Robat, on the Perso-Beluch
frontier, with the long-talked-of railway to
Quetta, but of this we shall have occasion to
speak later. So far the line has been sanctioned
to Nushki, but that point, it must be remembered,
is still 500 miles distant from Sistan, a considerable
distance across, what is for practical purposes,
desert country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-170" id="Pg_2-170"></a>[<a href="./images/2-170.png">170</a>]</span></p>

<p>The third point&mdash;the easiest of all, which
would involve little expense, but would have a
most salutary effect&mdash;would be to maintain a
small garrison at the Perso-Beluch-Afghan frontier
post of Robat. This, to my mind, would at the
present moment strengthen the hands of our
officials in Persia to a most extraordinary
extent.</p>

<p>Something tangible, which the natives themselves
could see and talk about, together with the
knowledge that a smart body of soldiers could
soon be on the spot if required, would not only
assure the so far doubtful safety of the few but
precious English lives in those parts, but would
add enormously to our prestige and make us not
only revered but feared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the Sistan Vice-Consulate does
not go back very far, but is, nevertheless, very
interesting. We will recapitulate it in a few
words.</p>

<p>Major Brazier-Creagh was sent to Sistan on
a special mission; as has already been said, and
Captain F. C. Webb-Ware, C. I. E., Political
Assistant at Chagai, visited the place every year
at the end of his annual trip along the new
route in North Beluchistan from Quetta to
Robat, the most Eastern station of the route
prior to entering Persian territory. Major
Sykes visited Sistan in 1896 in connection with
the Perso-Beluch Boundary Commission and
again in 1899, when he travelled here from
Kerman by the easier southern route <i>via</i> Bam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-172" id="Pg_2-172"></a>[<a href="./images/2-172.png">172</a>]</span></p>

<p>It was on February 15th, 1900, that a Russian
Vice-Consul for that important Province was
appointed to Sistan to take the place of a Persian
who was a news-writer in Russian employ.
Major G. Chevenix Trench was then specially
selected by the Viceroy of India as a suitable
person to look after British interests in that
region&mdash;and indeed no better man could have
been chosen.</p>

<p>Having given up his appointment in India this
officer left Quetta on March 7th, 1900, and
arrived at Sher-i-Nasrya on the 18th of April,
accompanied by Major R. E. Benn, who was
on a year's furlough, and can be said, I believe,
to be the first European who has travelled all
the way from India to England by this overland
route, <i>via</i> Meshed-Transcaspia.</p>

<p>Major Trench, prior to leaving for Meshed
to take up his appointment of Consul-General
for Khorassan, being unable to stand the fierce
heat of the sun, laid the foundation stone&mdash;it
was a "sun-dried mud brick," to be accurate&mdash;of
the present temporary buildings of the
Consulate. A domed mud hut <i>&agrave; la Persane</i>
was built, with an additional spacious window,
but no framework and no glass.</p>

<p>The great difficulty of hoisting the British
flag, which seems to have been strongly objected
to during the Perso-Afghan Commission when
Sir Frederic Goldsmid passed through Sistan
in 1872, was overcome mainly owing to the
great tact shown by Major Trench. The
Union Jack flew daily, gaily and undisturbed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-173" id="Pg_2-173"></a>[<a href="./images/2-173.png">173</a>]</span>
over the mud hovel which will probably be
during the next few years one of the most
important consular posts we possess in Asia.</p>

<p>Major Benn, who had hastily proceeded to
London on a long expected holiday, was immediately
recalled to replace Major Trench.
Major Benn, accompanied by his plucky and
devoted wife and child, journeyed a second time
across the Beluchistan desert to reach his post.</p>

<p>The journey was terrible, owing to torrential
rains and snowstorms. When already several
marches out they were compelled to return to
Quetta as their child had become very ill. But
they were despatched again on their duty.
They encountered severe storms; the country
was practically flooded; some of their camels
died, and for days at a time they were in the
desert unable to move, the country being in
many places inundated. In a blizzard two of
their men lost themselves and died from exposure,
but the party advanced slowly but
surely, the plucky little English lady standing
all the hardships without a murmur.</p>

<p>Major Benn having been ordered to make a
detour, they went down into the Sarhad, south
of the Kuh-i-Malek-Siah, and it was not till
February 15th, 1901, that they eventually
reached Sher-i-Nasrya, and were received by
Trench in his mud-hut Consulate, he having
moved into a tent. Major Trench, on the
arrival of Major Benn, proceeded to Meshed.</p>

<p>During Major Benn's time the Consulate
buildings went through a marvellous evolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-174" id="Pg_2-174"></a>[<a href="./images/2-174.png">174</a>]</span>
It may be recollected that I reached Sistan in
December, 1901, or only ten months after his
arrival, but there were already several additional
mud-rooms built and connected so as to form a
suite of a spacious office, sitting-room, dining-room,
two bedrooms and a storeroom. There
were doors, made locally by imported Indian
carpenters, but no glass to the windows,&mdash;muslin
nailed to the wall answering the purpose of
blinds. Famished dogs, attracted by the odour
of dinner, would occasionally jump through this
flimsy protection, much to the despair of Mrs.
Benn&mdash;but those were only small troubles.
Thieves found their way into the rooms, and
even succeeded in stealing Mrs. Benn's jewellery.
There was no protection whatever against an
attack in force, and the natives were at first most
impudent in their curiosity.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-031.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-031_th.jpg" alt="The Sistan Consulate on Christmas Day, 1901." title="The Sistan Consulate on Christmas Day, 1901." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Sistan Consulate on Christmas Day, 1901.</p>

<p>Being a Mussulman country, things were at
first very uncomfortable for Mrs. Benn until the
natives got accustomed to the sight of an English
lady, she being the first they had ever seen, or
who had ever travelled so far.</p>

<p>The temporary mud-rooms were gradually
furnished and decorated with so much taste that
they became simply charming, but a new Consulate
is now being built, which, by comparison
in size and style, seems quite palatial. It is
being constructed of real baked bricks, Major
Benn having put up a serviceable kiln for the
purpose, and the handsome structure is so
sensibly built after a design by the versatile
Consul, that when finished it will fully combine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-175" id="Pg_2-175"></a>[<a href="./images/2-175.png">175</a>]</span>
English comfort with the exigencies of the
climate, the incessant northerly winds of the
summer months&mdash;from June to the end of
August&mdash;rendering life unbearable unless suitable
arrangements to mitigate their effects are
provided.</p>

<p>Into the northern wall <i>ka khanas</i> or "camel
thorn compartments" are being built some four
feet deep, filled with camel thorn. To make
them effective two coolies are employed all day
long to swish buckets of water on to them. The
wind forcing its way through causes rapid
evaporation and consequent cooling of the air
in the rooms. When the wind stops the heat is,
however, unbearable. The rooms are also provided
with <i>badjirs</i>, or wind-catchers, on the
domed roof, but these can only be used before
the heat becomes too great.</p>

<p>An attempt had been made to start a garden,
both for vegetables and flowers, but the hot
winds burnt up everything. Only four cabbages
out of hundreds that were planted had survived,
and these were carefully nursed by Mrs. Benn
for our Christmas dinner. Unluckily, on Christmas
Eve a cow entered the enclosure and made
a meal of the lot!</p>

<p>Another garden is being started, but great
difficulty is experienced in making anything
grow owing to the quantity of salt in the ground
and the terrific winds. Poplars have come up
fairly well under shelter of a wall, but no tree
can hope to stand upright when it attains a
height where the wind can reach it. In fact,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-176" id="Pg_2-176"></a>[<a href="./images/2-176.png">176</a>]</span>
what few trees one sees about near Sher-i-Nasrya
are stooping southward in a pitiful manner.</p>

<p>The Consul's horses and those of the escort
are kept out in the open. They are tethered
and left well wrapped up, wearing nearly
double the amount of covering to protect them
from the heat during the hot summer months
that they do in winter, on the principle explained
in previous chapters. It is not possible
to keep them in stables, owing to the
terrible white fly, which has a poisonous sting.
When out in the open the flies and mosquitoes
are blown away by the wind.</p>

<p>It was satisfactory to find that, although the
Government did not see its way to furnish the
Consulate with a wall for the protection of the
Consul and his wife, whose personal property
was constantly being stolen, an allowance was at
once granted with instructions to build at once
a high wall all round the Consulate when one
of the Government horses was stolen!</p>

<p>This wall, a wonderful bit of work, was put
up in a fortnight, while I was in bed with fever,
and on my getting up from bed I had the
surprise of finding the Consulate, which, when
I had arrived, stood&mdash;a few lonely buildings&mdash;in
the middle of a sandy plain, now surrounded by
a handsome mud wall with a most elaborate
castellated, fortress-like gate of Major Benn's
own design. The wall encloses a good many
acres of land; it would be rash to say how
many! This has given rise among the natives
to the report that a new city is rising near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-177" id="Pg_2-177"></a>[<a href="./images/2-177.png">177</a>]</span>
Sher-i-Nasrya, called Trenchabad, or Trench's
city.</p>

<p>Major Benn is to be complimented on the
wonderful work he succeeds in getting done
with comparatively little expenditure for the
Government, and there is no doubt that he
manages to impress the natives and to keep
England's prestige high. He imported from
Quetta a flagstaff, in pieces, which when erected
measured no less than 45 feet, and on this, the
highest flagstaff in Persia, flies from sunrise to
sunset the Union Jack. Except on grand occasions
only a small flag can be used in summer,
owing to the fierce winds which tear the larger
flags to pieces the moment they are put up.</p>

<p>Major Benn scored heavily in the esteem of
Sistanis when he had the bright idea of erecting
a handsome little mosque within the Consulate
boundary, wherein any traveller, whether Persian
or Beluch or Afghan or any other Mussulman,
can find shelter and a meal at the private expense
of the Consul. People devoid of a house, too,
or beggars when in real need are always helped.</p>

<p>The erection of this mosque has greatly impressed
the Persians with the respect of England
for the Mahommedan religion. On the religious
festival day of the "sheep eat" the place is
crowded with Beluch and Persians alike, the
Mahommedan members of the British Consulate
having raised a fund to feed all worshippers at
the mosque during the day.</p>

<p>Major Benn, who has really the energy of
half-a-dozen men taken together, has organised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-178" id="Pg_2-178"></a>[<a href="./images/2-178.png">178</a>]</span>
some weekly gymkhanas, with the double object
of giving his Indian escort of fourteen men of
the 7th Bombay Lancers and a Duffadar (non-commissioned
native officer) a little recreation,
and of providing some amusement to the town
folks; exhibitions of horsemanship, tent-pegging
and sword exercises are given, in which some
of the Persian gentlemen occasionally also take
part.</p>

<p>The Sistanis of all classes turn out in great
force to witness these displays, and&mdash;for a
Persian crowd&mdash;I was really amazed at their
extraordinarily quiet and respectful demeanour.
Each man who entered the grounds courteously
salaamed the Consul before sitting down, and
there was unstinted clapping of hands&mdash;a way
of applauding which they have learnt from
Benn&mdash;and great enthusiasm as the Lancers displayed
their skill at the various feats.</p>

<p>The phonograph was also invariably brought
out on these occasions, and set working near the
flagstaff, much to the delight and astonishment
of the Sistanis, who, I believe, are still at a loss
to discover where the voices they hear come
from. To study the puzzled expressions on the
awe-stricken faces of the natives, as they intently
listened to the music, was intensely amusing,
especially when the machine called out such
words as "mamma," which they understood, or
when it reproduced the whistling of a nightingale,
which sent them raving with delight.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most touching part of these
performances was when loyal Major Benn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-179" id="Pg_2-179"></a>[<a href="./images/2-179.png">179</a>]</span>
wound up with "God save the King," scraped
on the record by a tired and blunted needle&mdash;phonograph
needles are scarce in Sistan and
could not be renewed for the sake of only one
and last tune&mdash;and we Britishers removed our
hats. Now, to the natives of Persia removing
one's hat seems as ludicrous a thing as can be
done, just as their equivalent discarding of shoes
seems very ridiculous to us; but the natives, to
whom the meaning we attach to our National
Anthem had been explained, behaved with the
utmost reverence notwithstanding the trying circumstances,
and many actually placed their right
hands to their foreheads in sign of salaam until
the anthem was over.</p>

<p>Another department in the Consulate of great
interest is the spacious hospital containing a well-supplied
dispensary, where an average of forty
daily patients are treated gratis by Dr. Golam
Jelami and a compounder.</p>

<p>Patients came on in their turn with various
complaints, and they were disposed of with due
speed, undergoing the necessary treatment with
various degrees of grace.</p>

<p>The hospital contains besides the dispensary,
an in-patients' and an accident ward, office,
operating room and doctor's quarters, the whole
place being kept beautifully clean by Indian
attendants&mdash;Dr. Golam Jelami taking great pride
in his work and in the success and efficacy of the
establishment.</p>

<p>Being himself a Mussulman Dr. Golam Jelami
has a great advantage over a Christian doctor in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-180" id="Pg_2-180"></a>[<a href="./images/2-180.png">180</a>]</span>
attending the natives, and, in fact, he has become
the medical adviser to the Amir and his entire
family, and a favourite with all the <i>Darbaris</i> or
people at the Amir's court owing to his extreme
tact, skill and charm of manner.</p>

<p>He has performed some quite extraordinary
operations. One day when the Consul and Mrs.
Benn were about to sit down to lunch, a huge
tumour, which had just been excised from the
back of a man's neck, was sent round on a tray
for the Consul's inspection; and lenses of the
eye from successful cataract operations are
frequently sent in for the Consul's approval.</p>

<p>The climate of Sistan is very healthy generally,
and the Halmund water delicious&mdash;by some it is
said to be an actual tonic&mdash;but the hot winds of
the summer and the salt sand cause severe injury to
the eyes. Cataract is a most common complaint,
even in comparatively young persons. Also
ophthalmia in its two forms. Confusion of vision
is frequent even among children, and myopia,
but not so common as the opacity of the cornea.</p>

<p>The most common complaint is the "Sistan
Sore," which affects people on the face or any
other part of the body. It is known by the local
name of <i>Dana-i-daghi</i>. It begins with irregularly-shaped
pustules&mdash;very seldom circular&mdash;that
come to suppuration and burst, and if not
checked in time last for several months, extending
on the skin surface, above which they hardly
rise.</p>

<p>The digestion of Sistanis, although naturally
good, is interfered with by the abuse of bad food,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-181" id="Pg_2-181"></a>[<a href="./images/2-181.png">181</a>]</span>
such as <i>krut</i>, or dried curd&mdash;most rancid,
indigestible stuff.</p>

<p>Venereal complaints are also most common,
the most terrible form of all, curiously enough,
being treated even by Persian doctors with
mercury&mdash;a treatment called the <i>Kalyan Shingrif</i>&mdash;but
administered in such quantities that its
effects are often worse than the ailment
itself.</p>

<p>Partly owing to this complaint and stomach
troubles and the chewing of tobacco, the teeth
are usually bad, black and decayed even in young
people, nor have the Sistanis themselves any way
of saving the teeth.</p>

<p>Siphylitic tonsilitis is almost the only throat
complaint noticeable in Sistan, but inflammation
of the palate is not rare. Heart disease is practically
unknown in Sistan, and there are but very
few lung affections.</p>

<p>The bones of the skeleton are extremely hard
and possess abnormal elasticity of texture, and
are, therefore, not easily fractured.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of hair diseases caused
by climatic conditions and dirt, as well as
cutaneous affections of the scalp.</p>

<p>The nails both of fingers and toes are healthy,
not brittle, with well-marked fibre showing
through their smooth surface, and of good
shape.</p>

<p>The tape worm, so common in many other
parts of Persia, is absolutely unknown in Sistan,
and this is probably due to the excellent water
obtainable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-182" id="Pg_2-182"></a>[<a href="./images/2-182.png">182</a>]</span></p>

<p>Lunacy is also scarcely ever met with in Sistan
in any violent form, but cases of hypochondria
are not unusual, produced principally by indigestion&mdash;at
least, judging by the symptoms
shown.</p>

<p>The women are much healthier than the men,
as they lead a more rational life, but neither
possess the power of producing large families.
One or two is the average number of children
in healthy families. Twins and triplets are
unknown in Sistan, or so I was assured.</p>

<p>The mode of life of Sistan men of the better
classes is not conducive to large families, the
men not returning to their wives till midnight
or later, having spent the greater part of the day
in orgies with their friends, when, what with
opium smoking and what with being stuffed
with food and saturated with gallons of tea, they
are dead tired.</p>

<p>Abortion seldom occurs naturally, and is never
artificially procured, owing to the local laws.
Women do not experience any difficulty during
labour and operations are unheard of.</p>

<p>The umbilicus of children, here, too, as in
Western Persia, is tied at birth in two or three
places with a common string, and the remainder
cut with a pair of scissors or a knife. A mid-wife,
called <i>daya</i>, is requested to perform this
operation. Abnormalities of any kind are
extremely uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was my intention to remain in Sistan only four
or five days, but unluckily my fever got so
bad&mdash;temperature above 104&deg;&mdash;that, notwithstanding
my desire to continue the journey,
Major Benn most kindly would not allow me. I
was placed in bed where, covered up with
every available blanket, I remained close upon
three weeks. The tender care of Major and
Mrs. Benn, to whom my gratitude cannot be
expressed in words, the skilful treatment of
Dr. Golam Jelami, the Consulate doctor,&mdash;not to
speak of the unstinted doses of quinine, phenacetin,
castor-oil, and other such delightful fare,
to which may also be added some gallons of the
really delicious water of the Halmund river,&mdash;at
last told upon me and eventually, after twenty-one
days of sweating I began to pull up again
and was able to get up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-184" id="Pg_2-184"></a>[<a href="./images/2-184.png">184</a>]</span></p>

<p>The fever was shaken off altogether, but
strange to say, whether it was that I was
unaccustomed to medicine, or whether it was
due to the counter-effects of the violent fever,
my temperature suddenly went down and remained
for several months varying from two to
three degrees below normal. Medical men tell
me that this should mean physical collapse, but
on this point I can only say that I have never in
my life felt stronger nor better.</p>

<p>I was just out of bed on Christmas Day, when
the Consulate was decorated with flags, and
Major Benn in his uniform had his escort of
Bombay Lancers on parade. There was an
official Christmas dinner in good old English
style, with a fine plum pudding and real sixpences
in it, followed by fire-crackers; while
illuminations were burning bright on the
Consulate wall and roofs. Official visitors were
received, the doctor of the Russian Vice-Consulate
and the Belgian Customs Officer forming
the whole European community of Sher-i-Nasrya.</p>

<p>Sadek, who was great on charity, especially
when it went to my account, in order to thank
Providence for my recovery sacrificed two sheep,
and their meat was distributed to the clamouring
poor. Such an expedient was necessary, Sadek
said, or I should certainly get fever again!</p>

<p>Owing to the Russian calendar being in disagreement
with ours, the Consul, Mrs. Benn
and I were most cordially entertained to a
second Christmas dinner by the Russian Consul,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-185" id="Pg_2-185"></a>[<a href="./images/2-185.png">185</a>]</span>
who had just returned from Meshed, and we
had a most delightful evening. For a convalescent,
I could not help thinking so many
Christmas dinners coming together might have
been fatal, but fortunately, owing entirely to the
charming and thoughtful kindness of my hosts,
both English and Russian, I managed to pull
through with no very ill effects. The Consular
escort of Cossacks looked very business-like and
smart as they paraded in the yard which had
been duly illuminated for the occasion.</p>

<p>The Amir expressed a wish to see me, and as
I was just able to get on a horse the Consul and
I paid an official visit to the Governor in the
citadel. We rode in full state with the escort
of Lancers, and traversed the town along the
main street, entering from the South gate.</p>

<p>I was again much struck by the intense
respect shown by the natives towards Major
Benn, all rising as we passed and making a
profound salaam. We traversed the greater
portion of the city by the main street, and
then arrived at the gate of the citadel in the
north-west part of Sher-i-Nasrya.</p>

<p>The door was so low that we had some
difficulty in entering without dismounting, and
just as we were squeezing in, as it were, through
this low passage, one of the disreputable-looking
soldiers on guard fired his gun&mdash;in sign of salute&mdash;which
somewhat startled our horses and set
them a-kicking.</p>

<p>In the small court where we dismounted was
a crowd of soldiers and servants, and here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-186" id="Pg_2-186"></a>[<a href="./images/2-186.png">186</a>]</span>
another salute was fired by the sentry. Through
winding, dilapidated passages and broken-down
courts we were conveyed to the Amir's room&mdash;a
very modest chamber, whitewashed, and with
humble carpets on the floor. A huge wood
fire was burning in the chimney, and the furniture
consisted of a table and six chairs, three
folding ones and three Vienna cane ones,
arranged symmetrically on either side of the
table.</p>

<p>The Amir sat on a folding chair on one side
of the table, and the Consul, Ghul Khan and
myself in a row on the opposite side. We were
most cordially received by Hashmat-ul-Mulk,
the Amir, who&mdash;this being Ramzam or fasting
time&mdash;showed ample evidence of mis-spent nights.
He had all the semblance of a person addicted to
opium smoking. His Excellency was unshaven
and unwashed, and seemed somewhat dazed, as
if still under the effects of opium. His discoloured
eyes stared vaguely, now at the Consul,
now at Ghul Khan, now at me, and he occasionally
muttered some compliment or other at
which we all bowed.</p>

<p>Presently, however, his conversation became
most interesting, when, having gone through all
these tedious preliminary formalities, he began
to describe to me the many ruined cities of
Sistan. He told me how at one time, centuries
and centuries gone by, Sistan was the centre of
the world, and that a city existed some twenty
miles off, named Zaidan, the length of which was
uninterrupted for some eighty or ninety miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-187" id="Pg_2-187"></a>[<a href="./images/2-187.png">187</a>]</span></p>

<p>"The remains of this city," he said, "are still
to be seen, and if you do not believe my words
you can go and see for yourself. In fact," added
the Amir, "you should not leave Sistan without
going to inspect the ruins. The city had flat
roofs in a continuous line, the houses being built
on both sides of a main road. A goat or a
sheep could practically have gone along the
whole length of the city," went on the Amir, to
enforce proof of the continuity of buildings
of Zaidan. "But the city had no great breadth.
It was long and narrow, the dwellings being
along the course of an arm of the Halmund
river, which in those days, before its course was
shifted by moving sands, flowed there. The
ruined city lies partly in Afghan, partly in
Sistan territory. In many parts it is covered
altogether by sand, but, by digging, houses, and
in them jewellery and implements, are to be
found all along."</p>

<p>I promised the Amir that I would go and
visit Zaidan city the very next day.</p>

<p>When we had once begun talking, the Amir
spoke most interestingly, and I was glad to obtain
from him very valuable and instructive information.
One hears accounts in some quarters of
the Persian officials being absolutely pro-Russian
and showing incivility to British subjects, but
on the contrary the Amir positively went out
of his way to show extreme civility. He
repeatedly inquired after my health and expressed
his fervent wishes that fever should no
more attack me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-188" id="Pg_2-188"></a>[<a href="./images/2-188.png">188</a>]</span></p>

<p>"What do you think of my beloved city,
Sher-i-Nasrya?" he exclaimed. I prudently
answered that in my travels all over the world
I had never seen a city like it, which was quite
true.</p>

<p>"But you look very young to have travelled
so much?" queried the Amir.</p>

<p>"It is merely the great pleasure of coming to
pay your Excellency a visit that makes me look
young!" I replied with my very best, temporarily
adopted, Persian manner, at which the
Amir made a deep bow and placed his hand
upon his heart to show the full appreciation of
the compliment.</p>

<p>He, too, like all Persian officials, displayed
the keenest interest in the Chinese war of 1900
and the eventual end of China. He spoke bitterly
of the recluse Buddhists of Tibet, and I
fully endorsed his views. Then again, he told
me more of historical interest about his province,
and of the medical qualities of the Halmund
water&mdash;which cures all evils. More elaborate
compliments flowed on all sides, and numberless
cups of steaming tea were gradually sipped.</p>

<p>Then we took our leave. As a most unusual
courtesy, the Consul told me, and one meant as a
great honour, the Amir came to escort us and
bid us good-bye right up to the door,&mdash;the usual
custom being that he rises, but does not go beyond
the table at which he sits.</p>

<p>Out we went again through the same narrow
passages, stooping so as not to knock our heads
against the low door-way, and came to our horses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-189" id="Pg_2-189"></a>[<a href="./images/2-189.png">189</a>]</span>
The soldier on guard fired another salute with
his gun, and Ghul-Khan, who happened to be
near at the time, nearly had his eye put out
by it.</p>

<p>As we rode through the gate a number of
prisoners&mdash;seven or eight&mdash;laden with chains
round the neck and wrists and all bound together,
were being led in. They salaamed us
and implored for our protection, but we could
do nothing. I could not help feeling very sorry
for the poor devils, for the way justice is administered
in Sistan, as in most parts of Persia, is not
particularly attractive. The tendons of the
hands or feet are cut even for small offences,
hot irons are thrust into the criminal's limbs,
and other such trifling punishments are inflicted
if sufficient money is not forthcoming
from the accused or their relations to buy
them out.</p>

<p>Here is an example of Persian justice. While
I was in bed with fever, one day Major and Mrs.
Benn went for a ride along the wall of the city,
with their usual escort. On reaching the city
gate they saw several people come out, and they
were startled by a shot being fired close by them,
and a dead body was laid flat across the road.
The dead man, it appeared, had been himself a
murderer and had been kept in chains in the
Amir's custody, pending trial. The verdict might
have possibly turned in his favour had he been
willing to grease the palms of the jailors, in accordance
with old Persian custom; but although
the man was very well off, he refused to disburse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-190" id="Pg_2-190"></a>[<a href="./images/2-190.png">190</a>]</span>
a single shai. He was therefore there and then
handed over to the relations of the murdered
man so that they should mete out to him what
punishment they thought fit.</p>

<p>The man was instantly dragged through the
streets of the city, and on arriving outside the
city gate they shot him in the back. The body
was then left in the road, the Persian crowd
which had assembled round looking upon the
occurrence as a great joke, and informing Major
Benn that the corpse would remain there until
some of his relations came to fetch it away.
On referring the matter to the Governor the
following day, he smilingly exclaimed: "An
eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!"&mdash;a
quotation from the Koran that quite cleared
his conscience.</p>

<p>This is a very common way of disposing of
criminals in Persia by allowing personal revenge
to take its course. Although such ways of
administering justice may not commend themselves
to one, the moral of it as looked upon
by Persian eyes is not as bad as it might at first
appear. The honest, the well-to-do man, they
reason, has nothing whatever to fear from anybody,
and if a man chooses to be a criminal,
he must take the consequences of it. The
more severe the punishment the less crime there
will be in the country. Persian law prevents
crime.</p>

<p>In a province like Sistan, where the people are
not quite up-to-date as in other parts of Persia,
naturally, ways which to us may seem very cruel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-191" id="Pg_2-191"></a>[<a href="./images/2-191.png">191</a>]</span>
have to be applied by the Amir to impress the
people. If fines to the maximum of the prisoner's
purse are excepted, the usual way of satisfying
the law for almost any offence, the next most
common punishment is the bastinado applied on
the bare soles of the feet. When an option is
left to the prisoner of undergoing the bastinado
or paying a fine, he generally selects the sticks,
which he feels much less than the anguish of
disbursing the smallest sum in cash. Minor
crimes only are so punished&mdash;it is considered the
lightest punishment. Occasionally it is used to
obtain confessions. People are seldom known to
die under it.</p>

<p>Disfigurement, or deprivation of essential limbs,
such as one or more phalanges of fingers, or the
ears or nose, is also much in vogue for thieves,
house-breakers and highwaymen. For second
offences of criminals so branded the whole hand
or foot is cut off. Blinding, or rather, atrophizing
the eyes by the application of a hot iron in front,
but not touching them, such as is common all
over Central Asia, is occasionally resorted to in
the less civilised parts of Persia, but is not frequent
now. I only saw one case of a man who had
been so punished, but many are those who have
the tendons of arms and legs cut&mdash;a favourite
punishment which gives the most dreadfully
painful appearance to those who have undergone
it.</p>

<p>Imprisonment is considered too expensive for
the Government, and is generally avoided except
in the bigger cities. The prisoners have a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-192" id="Pg_2-192"></a>[<a href="./images/2-192.png">192</a>]</span>
poor time of it, a number of them being chained
close together.</p>

<p>To burn people or to bury them alive are
severe punishments which are very seldom heard
of now-a-days, but which occasionally take place
in some remote districts and unknown to his
Majesty the Shah, who has ever shown a tender
heart and has done all in his power to suppress
barbarous ways in his country; but cases or
crucifixion and stoning to death have been
known to have occurred not many years ago&mdash;if
not as a direct punishment from officials, yet
with their indirect sanction.</p>

<p>Strangling and decapitation are still in use, and
I am told&mdash;but cannot guarantee its accuracy&mdash;that
blowing criminals from guns is rarely
practised now, although at one time this was a
favourite Persian way of disposing of violent
criminals.</p>

<p>A Persian official was telling me that, since
these terrible punishments have been to a great
extent abolished, crimes are more frequent in
Persia than they were before. The same man&mdash;a
very enlightened person, who had travelled in
Europe&mdash;also remarked to me that had we
to-day similar punishments in Europe instead
of keeping criminals on the fat of the land&mdash;(I
am only repeating his words)&mdash;we should
not have so much crime in the country.
"Your laws," he added, "protect criminals;
our ways deter men and women from crime.
To prevent crime, no matter in how cruel a
way it is done, is surely less cruel than to show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-193" id="Pg_2-193"></a>[<a href="./images/2-193.png">193</a>]</span>
leniency and kindness to the persons who do
commit crimes!"</p>

<p>That was one way of looking at it. Taking
things all round, if blood feuds and cases of
personal revenge are excepted, there is certainly
less crime in Persia than in many European
countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Consul, Mrs. Benn and I, started off early
one morning on horseback to inspect the ruins of
the ancient London of the East, the great city of
Zaidan, which in the days of its glory measured
no less than eighty-six miles&mdash;from Lash Yuwain
on the north to Kala-i-Fath on the South&mdash;ruins
of the city being traceable the whole distance to
this day, except in the portion which has been
covered by the waters of the Hamun Halmund.</p>

<p>On the way there was little to be seen for the
first four miles until we reached the village of
Bunjar, the biggest trading village in Sistan and
the residence of the Iman Jumeh, the next holiest
man to the head priest of Sher-i-Nasrya. This
village and neighbourhood supply Sher-i-Nasrya
entirely with wood and very largely with food.
There are many stunted trees about, all curved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-195" id="Pg_2-195"></a>[<a href="./images/2-195.png">195</a>]</span>
southwards by the wind, and much cultivated
land, the ground being intersected by numerous
natural and artificial water channels.</p>

<p>A very curious ancient tower, split in two, and
the portion of another very much corroded at its
base, and looking like a big mushroom, are to be
seen on the south near this village. We cut
across, almost due east, to Iskil, wading through
several canals and channels into which our horses
dived up to their saddles.</p>

<p>On approaching Iskil from the west one was
impressed by the unusual height of some of its
buildings, most of which were two-storied and
had domed roofs, the domes being of much larger
proportions than usual. A quadrangular tower
of considerable loftiness stood prominent above
the height of all the other buildings. For a
Persian village Iskil had quite a clean, fresh
appearance, even from a short distance. On
getting near we entered the main road&mdash;one
might more accurately call it a canal&mdash;walled in
on both sides and filled with water some eight or
ten inches deep. Our horses waded through, and
having rounded another large pond of dirty green
water&mdash;such as is always found in the more
prosperous villages of Persia&mdash;we came to a high
wall enclosing a garden and an Andarun near the
residence of the Kalantar of Sistan (Kalantar
means the "bigger one"), the title taken by the
head of the tribe who in by-gone days were the
masters of the whole of Sistan.</p>

<p>The Kalantar is a large landowner, and has the
contract for all the grazing tax of East Sistan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-196" id="Pg_2-196"></a>[<a href="./images/2-196.png">196</a>]</span>
Among the villages owned by him are Iskil,
Bunjar, and Kas-im-abad, the three richest in
Sistan. The name of Kalantar is taken by each
of the family as he succeeds to the possession of
these villages, lands, and rights.</p>

<p>The Kalantar, previous to the one now in
possession, was a man of most commanding
presence, very tall and very stout&mdash;the biggest
man in Sistan&mdash;and much respected by everybody.
He was extremely friendly towards the
English. He had planted an entire garden of
English flowers and fruit at Iskil, and took the
keenest interest in horticulture and agriculture.
Above all, however, he was renowned for a
magnificent collection of ancient seals, coins,
jewellery, implements, beads, and other curiosities,
of which he had amassed chests and chests
full that had been dug up from the great city of
Zaidan and neighbourhood. Some of the cameos
were very delicately cut in hard stone, and
reminded one of ancient Greek work. Symbolic
representations in a circle, probably to suggest
eternity, were favourite subjects of these ornamentations,
such designs as a serpent biting its
own tail, or three fishes biting one another's tails
and forming a circle, being of frequent occurrence.
So also were series of triangles and
simple circles. The gold rings were most
beautifully delicate and simple in design, and so
were all the other ornaments, showing that the
people of Zaidan had a most refined civilisation
which is not to be found in Persian art of to-day.
Personally, I have certainly never seen modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-197" id="Pg_2-197"></a>[<a href="./images/2-197.png">197</a>]</span>
Persian work which in any way approached in
beauty of line and execution to the articles
excavated from the great city of Zaidan.</p>

<p>A great profusion of beads of amber, jasper,
crystal, turquoise, malachite, agate, had been
found in Zaidan and some that we saw were handsomely
polished and cut, some were ornamented,
others were made of some composition like very
hard enamel. All&mdash;even the hardest crystal
ones&mdash;had clean holes drilled through them.</p>

<p>The Kalantar had built himself a fine residence
at Iskil, with huge rooms and lofty domes,
and here he kept these collections. His generous
nature had caused him to build a handsome
guest house in front of his dwelling in order to
put up and entertain his friends, native or
foreign.</p>

<p>It was on the steps of his guest house that the
last act of a terrible tragedy took place only a
short time before we visited Iskil. About ten
years ago, in 1891, a man called Mahommed
Hussein Khan, an Afghan refugee, came to live
in Bunjar, bringing with him a <i>sigah</i> wife (concubine),
her mother and a child. Shortly after
his arrival he left his family in Bunjar and went
on a pilgrimage to Meshed. No news was
received of him for a very long time, and the
wife wrote to him&mdash;when her money and
patience were exhausted&mdash;that if he did not
return on a certain date or answer her letter she
should consider herself divorced from him. He
replied that she might consider herself free from
the date of receipt of his letter, and requested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-198" id="Pg_2-198"></a>[<a href="./images/2-198.png">198</a>]</span>
her to send her mother in charge of his child to
Meshed.</p>

<p>During Mahommed Hussein's absence rumour
says that Kalantar Mir-Abbas had an intrigue
with the lady, and on receipt of her husband's
letter from Meshed he forcibly removed her from
Bunjar and compelled her to marry him, Mir-Abbas,
at Iskil.</p>

<p>Unluckily, the lady was a Suni and Kalantar
Mir-Abbas was a Shia, which made it difficult
to overcome certain religious obstacles. Such a
union would anyhow be greatly resented by
relations on both sides. In fact, about a year
ago, 1900, the lady's brother, a native of Girisk,
near Kandahar, enraged at his sister marrying a
man who was not an Afghan, and of a different
persuasion, came to Iskil with characteristically
treacherous Afghan ways and sought service with
the Kalantar, assuring him of the great affection
and devotion he entertained towards him. The
good-hearted Kalantar immediately gave him
employment and treated him most generously.</p>

<p>On the night of September 19th, 1901, the
Kalantar had been entertaining some friends in
the Durbar building opposite his residence,
among whom was the Afghan, who left the
room before Mir-Abbas and went to conceal
himself in the darkness at the entrance. When
the Kalantar was joyfully descending the steps
after the pleasant night assembly, the treacherous
Afghan attacked him and, placing his rifle to
Mir-Abbas' head, shot him dead. The assassin
then endeavoured to enter the Andarun to kill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-199" id="Pg_2-199"></a>[<a href="./images/2-199.png">199</a>]</span>
his sister, but the lady, having her suspicions, had
barricaded herself in, and an alarm being given
he had to make his escape across the Afghan
frontier only a few miles distant from Iskil.</p>

<p>It was rumoured that the murderer had
been sheltered by the Afghan Governor of
the Chikansur district, who goes by the grand
name of <i>Akhunzada</i>, or "The great man of a
high family." The Governor of Sistan, angered
at the infamous deed, demanded the extradition
of the assassin, but it was refused, with the
result that the Afghan official was next accused
of screening the murderer. There was much
interchange of furious correspondence and
threats between the Persian and Afghan
Governors, and their relations became so strained
that a fight seemed imminent.</p>

<p>The shrewd Afghan then offered to allow five
Persian soldiers, accompanied by twenty Afghans,
to search his district&mdash;an offer which was very
prudently declined. Persian and Afghan soldiers
were posted in some force on both sides of the
river&mdash;forming the frontier&mdash;and devoted their
time to insulting one another; but when I left
Sistan in January, 1902, although the relations
were still much strained, the affair of the
Kalantar, which seemed at one time likely to
turn into a national quarrel, was gradually being
settled on somewhat less martial lines.</p>

<p>The death of such a good, honest man has
been much regretted in Sistan, and great hopes
are now built on his son and successor, a young
fellow much resembling his father both in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-200" id="Pg_2-200"></a>[<a href="./images/2-200.png">200</a>]</span>
personal appearance and kindliness towards his
neighbours.</p>

<p>We next came to a second and smaller village
four miles further on&mdash;after having waded
through numberless water-channels, ponds and
pools and our horses having performed some
feats of balancing on bridges two feet wide or
even less. Some of these structures were so
shaky that the horses were not inclined to go
over them except after considerable urging.</p>

<p>The country between was flat and uninteresting,
except that here and there some low
mounds had formed where the sand blown by
the N.N.W. wind had been arrested by some
obstacle, such as a shrub of camel-thorn or
tamarisk. Most of these sand-barchans had a
striking peculiarity. They were semi-spherical
except to the S.S.E., where a section of the sphere
was missing, which left a vacuum in the shape
of a perfect crescent.</p>

<p>By the numberless waves on the sand surface
it seemed evident that the sand had accumulated
from the N.N.W. side.</p>

<p>The village was small and miserable, with a
few scraggy trees bowing low, like all trees of
Sistan, towards the S.S.E., owing to the severe,
N.N.W. winds. Here instead of the everlasting
domes, flat roofs were again visible&mdash;wood
being, no doubt, available close at hand. More
curious, however, were actual gable roofs, the
first I had noticed in Persia in purely native
houses. The ventilating apertures were not in
the roof itself, as in the domed houses, but in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-201" id="Pg_2-201"></a>[<a href="./images/2-201.png">201</a>]</span>
the walls, which were of a much greater height
than in the domed habitations. The doors
and windows were invariably on the south wall,
but to the north at the lower portion of the
roof in each house one could observe a triangular,
projecting structure, usually in the centre of the
upper wall. This was a different type of wind-catcher,
but in winter blocked up with sun-dried
bricks and mud.</p>

<p>Between this village and Zaidan there was
again a good deal of water to be crossed, and in
some spots it was so deep that our horses sank
into it up to their chests and we had to lie flat,
with our legs resting on the animals' backs, to
escape a ducking.</p>

<p>To our left&mdash;to the north&mdash;could be seen in
the distance a high tower, which is said to have
a spiral staircase inside, and must be of very
great height, as even from where we were&mdash;eight
miles away&mdash;it rose very high above the
horizon, some 70 feet, as we guessed, and looked
very big. This tower stood alone several miles
to the North of the principal Zaidan ruins for
which we were steering, and I had not therefore
time to visit it.</p>

<p>The pillar is locally called Mil-i-Zaidan, and
is circular in shape, made of kiln-baked bricks
cemented together by clay. On the summit,
above a broad band with ornamentations and
a much worn inscription can be seen the fragments
of two smaller structures, also cylindrical,
which may have been the supports of the dome
of the minaret. There is said to be another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-202" id="Pg_2-202"></a>[<a href="./images/2-202.png">202</a>]</span>
illegible inscription about thirty feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>According to Goldsmid, who visited this place
in 1872, the tower then stood on a square foundation,
and its circumference was 55 feet at the
base and only 28 feet at the summit. The lower
portion of the tower, as seen through powerful
glasses, seemed very much corroded, and it will
not be long before it collapses. There are
various theories regarding this tower, which now
rises directly above the flat desert. It is said by
some to be one of a number of isolated watch
towers, but this, I think, is incorrect.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-033.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-033_th.jpg" alt="The Citadel of Zaidan, the Great City." title="The Citadel of Zaidan, the Great City." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Citadel of Zaidan, the Great City.</p>

<p>According to Major Sykes, who quotes from
the Seljuk history: "Every three hundred paces
a pillar twice the height of a man was built and
two <i>minars</i> between Gurz and Fahraj, one forty
<i>gaz</i> high, the other twenty-five, and <i>under</i> each
<i>minar</i> a caravanserai and a tank." By the word
"under" the historian evidently meant directly
underneath the tower&mdash;which was the customary
way of constructing such buildings. The <i>minars</i>
seldom rose from the ground, but were and are
generally constructed on the roofs of buildings.
A proof that this was the case in this particular
instance was that when Goldsmid visited it in
1872, he stated that it "was built on a square
foundation."</p>

<p>The caravanserai underneath this tower and
the tank are evidently buried by the sand, as is
the case with a great portion of the City of
Zaidan. That there is underneath the sand a
city connecting the southern portion of Zaidan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-203" id="Pg_2-203"></a>[<a href="./images/2-203.png">203</a>]</span>&mdash;still
partly above ground&mdash;with the northern portion
of Zaidan, and that this <i>minar</i> rises above
buried habitations, there can be little doubt, for
all along the several miles of intervening sandy
stretch the earth is covered with debris, ruins and
fragments of tiles, bricks, &amp;c., &amp;c., showing the
remains of a great city.</p>

<p>As we went along, leaving the pillar to the
north and steering south-east for the main ruins
of Zaidan, we saw close by on the north a very
large structure forming the section of a cone&mdash;the
lower portion buried in sand and the upper
portion having collapsed,&mdash;which a Sistani who
accompanied us said was an ancient ice-house.
This theory may be correct, for it is probable
that the climate of Sistan may have greatly
changed; but it is also possible that the structure
may have been a large flour-mill, for to this day
mills are built in Persia on similar exterior lines
to the ice-houses. Structures of the same kind
are also to be observed as far south as Kala-i-Fath,
the southern terminus of the great city.</p>

<p>No ice to speak of can be collected nowadays,
either in Sistan or within a very large radius of
country, and snow is seldom, almost never seen.</p>

<p>Near this mill or ice-house, whichever it was,
another high building in ruins was to be observed,
but I could not afford the time to deviate from
my route and inspect it. It appeared like a
watch-tower, and was not dissimilar to two other
round towers we had seen before on the south,&mdash;very
likely they were all outer fire-signalling
stations, so common all over Asia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-204" id="Pg_2-204"></a>[<a href="./images/2-204.png">204</a>]</span></p>

<p>After a brisk ride of some four hours we
arrived at the main portion of the ruins of
Zaidan&mdash;an imposing fort on a clay hill, which
must have formed the citadel. At the foot of
the hill was the modern village of Zaidan&mdash;about
fifty houses, some with flat, others with gabled,
roofs, such as we had seen at the previous villages,
and a few with domed roofs. There were a few
cultivated fields in which wheat was raised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we approached the ruins we could not help
being impressed by their grandeur. They were
certainly the most imposing I had so far come
across in Persia. The high walls and towers of
the fort could be seen from a great distance, and
for the benefit of my readers a photograph is
reproduced in this book to show how the citadel
of this great city appeared as one drew near it
from the west. The photograph was taken half
a mile away from the fortress.</p>

<p>We entered the citadel by a short incline on
the northern side of the main fort and found ourselves
in a huge court, the sides of which were
much blocked towards the wall by sand drifts.
Contrary to what has been stated by others, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-206" id="Pg_2-206"></a>[<a href="./images/2-206.png">206</a>]</span>
citadel is not inhabited to-day, nor are there any
signs of its having been inhabited probably for a
great many years. There is nothing whatever to
be seen in the centre of this yard, which is covered
with accumulated sand far above its original level,
and at the sides, too, of the court, where buildings
would have very likely been, everything is
smothered in sand up to a great height of the
wall. In other places the wall has collapsed
altogether.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-035.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-035_th.jpg" alt="Towers of the Citadel, Zaidan." title="Towers of the Citadel, Zaidan." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Towers of the Citadel, Zaidan.</p>

<p>Remains of small rooms high up near the top
of the wall can be seen. The inside of the inner
fort enclosed by the highest wall is quadrangular,
and has ten towers round it, eight of which are
still in wonderful preservation considering their
age. Those at the angles of the quadrangle had
large, somewhat elongated, windows ending in a
point cut into them in two tiers, as may be seen in
the illustration. Curiously enough, while the
windows were six feet in height, the doors were
never more than five feet. There were rooms in all
the towers, but all were extremely small. The
largest averaged eight feet square. The walls of
the towers were of mud bricks with layers of
kiln-baked bricks, and were three to four feet
deep and of very great strength.</p>

<p>As can be seen by the illustration, a fragment
of an archway was to be found on the summit of
the wall and there were often signs that a covered
passage, such as may be found in other northern
forts of this great city, must have been in existence
when the place was in all its glory.</p>

<p>As one stood on the highest point of the wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-207" id="Pg_2-207"></a>[<a href="./images/2-207.png">207</a>]</span>
and looked around one got a fair idea of the
former immensity of the city. It evidently
stretched from south-east to north, forming an
obtuse angle at the citadel on which I stood.
To the south-east of the fortress, where sheltered
from the terrific north winds and from the sand
drifts, the ruins were in better preservation and
less covered with sand, which here indeed made
quite a depression, while the northern aspect now
displays a continuous mass of fine sand interrupted
only by some of the higher buildings projecting
above it.</p>

<p>One could distinguish quite plainly where the
wall of the city continued for a long distance to
the south-east with occasional towers, but this
portion of the wall, as seen in the illustration
facing page <a href="#Pg_2-208">208</a>, is now in a sad state of decay and
fast being covered with sand. The first three
hundred yards of it, which are the best preserved,
however, will show what a place of great strength
Zaidan must have been. The towers appear to
have been enormous, as shown by the base of the
nearer one in the foreground of the photograph,
and also by the second one, a portion of which
still remained standing.</p>

<p>The city boundary made a detour to the
south-east at the third tower, all the buildings
visible being on the east of the wall and none
to the west. The modern village of Zaidan
should, of course, be excepted.</p>

<p>There seems to have been a great space
intervening between this wall and the nearest
habitations, but why that was would now be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-208" id="Pg_2-208"></a>[<a href="./images/2-208.png">208</a>]</span>
difficult to ascertain except by digging to a
considerable depth. It seems hardly likely that
a moat with water should have been constructed
on the inside of the fortress, although at first
sight one might be led to conclude that this
was the case.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Double Wall and Circular Unroofed Structures, Zaidan.</span> In the distance high sand accumulations above City.</p>

<p>The city does not seem to have had a great
general breadth, and is mostly remarkable for
its enormous length, although at several of the
most important points it has indeed considerable
width. It extended mostly like a long line, and
one could still perceive, as far as the eye could
see, partially destroyed domed roofs, fragments
of walls, and in some cases entire structures still
standing and bearing roofs. The ice-house,
which we had passed on the way, stood prominent
to the north by north-west and also the
pillar, the <i>minar</i> of Mil-i-Zaidan.</p>

<p>Major Sykes makes a very quaint statement
in the <i>Geographical Journal</i> for February, 1902.
He says: "I have seen it stated by previous
travellers" (presumably Sir F. Goldsmid and
Bellew) "that the ruins of Zaidan extend for
fourteen miles, but the fact is that <i>there were
villages lining the Rud-i-Nasru throughout its
length</i> (a length of 30 miles according to Major
Sykes's maps), and these have been mistaken for
suburbs of the capital of Sistan."</p>

<p>It seems to me that Major Sykes has only
strengthened the contention of previous travellers
and that, whether one calls them suburbs
or a continuity of habitations, villages, or by
any other name, the fact is that continuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-209" id="Pg_2-209"></a>[<a href="./images/2-209.png">209</a>]</span>
miles of buildings can be traced. The Rud-i-Nasru
canal, according to Major Sykes's own
maps as given in the <i>Geographical Society's
Journal</i>, is over 30 miles in length, and if the
30 miles are lined <i>throughout</i> by villages surely
that fact further establishes the continuity of the
city.</p>

<p>Personally, however, I have my doubts
whether Major Sykes is correct in placing the
Rud-i-Nasru to the west of the city in Zaidan's
days of glory. There are signs of a canal, but
to the east of the city. The Hamun, too, I
think, no more stretched across from east to
west in the northern portion than it does to-day,
but rather formed two separate lakes&mdash;the
eastern one fed by the surplus water of the
Halmund; the western filled by the Farah
Rud. The space between is liable to be occasionally
flooded by the excess of water in these
two lakes, but that is all.</p>

<p>All the evidence goes to show that the great
city, under different local names, extended continuously
northwards as far as Lash Yuwain, passing
between the two marshy lakes. In the next
chapter I have brought undoubted evidence
pointing to that conclusion, and if any one is
still sceptical about it, all he has to do is to go
there and see for himself. In such a dry climate
the ruins, although gradually being covered over
with sand, will remain long enough for any one
wishing to spend some time there and to make
a thorough study of them.</p>

<p>To the east of the Zaidan fort, about 100 yards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-210" id="Pg_2-210"></a>[<a href="./images/2-210.png">210</a>]</span>
and 200 yards respectively, are the remains,
still fairly well preserved, of a high double wall,
castellated and with loop-holes half-way up the
wall. These two walls, where free from sand,
stand some 40 feet high, but in most portions the
sand has accumulated to a height of 15 to 20 feet.</p>

<p>These parallel walls were somewhat puzzling.
They were only a few feet apart and protected a
road between them which went from north-west
to south-east. Each wall was constructed very
strongly of two brick walls filled between with
beaten earth. The lower portion of the wall was
much corroded by the wind and sand, but the
upper part where it had not collapsed, was in
good preservation. There were rows of holes
at the bottom on the east side, where there
appeared to have been extensive stables with
mangers for horses. The lower portion of the
wall was of kiln-baked bricks, and the upper part
in horizontal layers of baked bricks every four
feet and mud bricks between.</p>

<p>Of the two parallel walls the eastern one was
not castellated, but the western or inner had a
castellated summit. There was an outer moat
or canal.</p>

<p>Only a comparatively small portion of this
double wall stood up to its former height&mdash;merely
a few hundred feet of it&mdash;but traces
could be seen that it must have extended for a
very long distance. It appeared to be tortuous
and not in a straight line, its direction being
plainly traceable even in the photograph reproduced
in the illustration facing page <a href="#Pg_2-208">208</a>. Only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-211" id="Pg_2-211"></a>[<a href="./images/2-211.png">211</a>]</span>
one tower of a quadrangular shape could be seen
along this wall, and the apertures in the wall
were at regular intervals of four feet. The
doorway in these walls appeared to have been
next to the quadrangular tower, which was very
likely constructed in order to guard the gate.</p>

<p>There were small circular unroofed structures
between the fort itself and this double wall, but
they appeared more like the upper sections of
towers than actual habitations. Though much
smaller and lower they bore all the architectural
characteristics of the towers of the greater fort,
and possessed windows, one above the other,
similar to those we had found in the larger
towers of the main fort. In the illustration
the reader can see for himself. That a considerable
portion of this structure is buried is
shown by the fact that the upper portion of a
window is just visible above the sand in the
circular building to the left of the observer.
These structures had in the interior some
elaborately moulded recesses, and ornamented
windows in pointed arches. The circular
building had three rooms on the floor still above
ground and six small recesses. One window
was in most excellent preservation.</p>

<p>Further on, beyond the double wall to the
south-east, was a most extensive graveyard, a
portion of which had been freed from sand by
the natives of the modern village of Zaidan.
There were hundreds and hundreds of tombs,
some in quite good preservation, as can be seen by
the two photographs facing pages 212 and 214.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-212" id="Pg_2-212"></a>[<a href="./images/2-212.png">212</a>]</span></p>

<p>The photograph facing page <a href="#Pg_2-212">212</a> shows the
eastern portion of the graveyard where some of
the tombs were altogether free from sand, and in a
splendid state of preservation. They were made
of kiln-burnt bricks plastered over with mud,
the body, it may be remarked, being enclosed in
these rectangular brick cases and entirely above
ground. They were mostly single tombs, not
compound graves, like some which we shall
inspect later on (Mount) Kuh-i-Kwajah. Their
measurements were about 7 feet by 4 feet by
3&frac12; feet, and they were extremely simple, except
that the upper face was ornamented by a
series of superposed rectangles diminishing in
size upwards and each of the thickness of one
brick, and the last surmounted generally by a
prism.</p>

<p class="illc">Graveyard of Zaidan City.</p>

<p>The photograph facing page <a href="#Pg_2-214">214</a> shows the
north-western portion of the graveyard, with the
entire eastern aspect of the Zaidan fortress. I took
this photograph for the special purpose of proving
how high the sand has accumulated over many
portions of the graveyard, as well as over a great
portion of the city. The particular spot where
I took the photograph was somewhat protected
from the north, hence the low depression, slightly
more free from sand than further back where
the sand, as can be seen, was able to settle down
to a great height. The upper portions of
several graves can be noticed mostly buried in
sand, and by the ripples on the sand and the
casting of the shadows (the photograph was
taken in the afternoon when the sun was west)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-213" id="Pg_2-213"></a>[<a href="./images/2-213.png">213</a>]</span>
it can be seen plainly that the sand has accumulated
from the north.</p>

<p>Under the immediate lee of the fortress and of
the outer walls, similar depressions in the sand
were found, and it is owing to these that some
portion of the city was still uncovered by sand.</p>

<p>In the photograph facing page <a href="#Pg_2-214">214</a> it may be
noticed that where the lee of the high fortress no
longer protects the buildings from the drifting
sand, the city gradually disappears, as it were,
under fairly high accumulations.</p>

<p>We shall find later, on our journey to the
Beluchistan frontier, how these sand accumulations,
in their turn, forming themselves into
barriers against the sands which came from the
north, allowed further southerly portions of the
city to escape unburied, which portions can be
seen extending in and out of these transverse sand
ridges as far south as Kala-i-Fath. North of the
Zaidan fortress the sand, finding no high
obstacles, has accumulated to a much greater
height, only very lofty buildings remaining
visible above the surface.</p>

<p>In the photograph facing page <a href="#Pg_2-206">206</a> this high
cushion, as it were, of sand can plainly be seen
over the north of the city beyond the tower of
the castle; also a portion of the small canal at
the foot of the tower, which some will have it
was the Rud-i-Nasru.</p>

<p>In the distance towards the south-east, two
quadrangular towers could be seen, which the
Katkhuda of Zaidan village told us formed part
of one of the former gates of the city. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-214" id="Pg_2-214"></a>[<a href="./images/2-214.png">214</a>]</span>
two towers can be seen in the background of
the photograph facing page <a href="#Pg_2-212">212</a>.</p>

<p>Some distance beyond the graveyard we came
to a section of a tower, heptagonal in form,
which had just been dug out to a depth of 4 feet
by the natives of the village of Zaidan. The
Katkhuda&mdash;who could have given points to an
Irishman&mdash;told us that this was the tomb of the
renowned legendary "Forty Saints of Zaidan,"
and added, that they numbered forty-four! On
being asked why it was called the tomb of the
forty saints if their number was forty-four, he
did not lose his presence of mind, but explained
that four had been added afterwards when this
sacred spot had already received its legendary
name.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-040.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-040_th.jpg" alt="East View of the Zaidan Citadel." title="East View of the Zaidan Citadel." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">East View of the Zaidan Citadel.</p>

<p>For a very long time the Zaidan people had
searched for this sacred spot, and they seemed
very proud to have discovered it. It is called by
them <i>Chil-pir</i>, or the "forty saints." As the
tower is not large enough to contain them all,
a number of them are said to be buried in the
immediate neighbourhood to the south and west
of the structure, and the Katkhuda, to prove his
words, showed us some three graves, more elaborate
than the rest. There were also others that
were anxiously searched for, but had not been
located yet.</p>

<p>The graves which I was shown were entirely
of kiln-burnt bricks, and so was the wall of the
tower itself, as can be seen by a portion of it
showing in the illustration facing page <a href="#Pg_2-218">218</a>, behind
the marble inscription and columns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-215" id="Pg_2-215"></a>[<a href="./images/2-215.png">215</a>]</span></p>

<p>Since its discovery the natives had made this
into a <i>Ziarat</i> or shrine, and on its western side
(towards Mecca) had adorned it with a bundle
of sticks, horns, and a number of rags, or pieces
of ribbon, white, red or blue. Every Mussulman
visiting it leaves an offering of a piece of
cloth generally from his coat or turban, if a man,
or from the chudder or other feminine wearing
apparel if a woman.</p>

<p>The Katkhuda told us that a great many things
had been found in digging near here, but the
more valuable ones had disappeared, sold to officials
or rich people of Sistan. A great many
seals, coins, stone weapons, lamps and pottery
had been found, the latter often glazed. Innumerable
fragments of earthenware were strewn
everywhere round about these ruins, some with
interesting ornamentations, generally blue on
white ground. The "parallel lines" and "heart
pattern" were common, while on some fragments
of tiles could be seen quotations from the
Koran in ancient Arabic. Some pieces of tiles
exhibited a very handsome blue glaze, and on
some plates the three leaf pattern, almost like
a fleur-de-lis, was attempted, in company with
the two-leaf and some unidentified flower.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all were the beautiful
inscriptions on stone and marble, recently been
found in the tomb of the Forty Saints. Some
had already been covered again by the sand, but
we dug them out afresh and I photographed
them. They were in fair preservation. They
bore Arabic characters, and were apparently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-216" id="Pg_2-216"></a>[<a href="./images/2-216.png">216</a>]</span>
dedicated in most laudatory terms, one to "the
Pomp of the country, Sun of righteousness and
religion, and the founder of a mosque"; the other
commemorated the death of a great Amir. As,
however, there appears to be some difficulty in
deciphering some of the very ancient characters
I will refrain from giving any translation of them
for fear of being inaccurate. The photographs
given of them facing pages 218, 220, 222, are,
however, quite clear enough for any one interested
in the matter to decipher them for himself.</p>

<p>These tablets were most artistic and beautifully
carved, and one had a most charming
ornamentation of two sprays of flowers in each of
the two upper corners. The second inscription
had much more minute writing on it, and was of
a finer design and cut, but was, unfortunately,
rather worn. It had evidently been subjected to
a long period of friction&mdash;apparently by sand.
The natives had made a sort of altar with this
last inscription and some cylindrical sections of
columns carved out of beautiful marble, white or
most delicately variegated.</p>

<p>There were also various other large pieces of
marble and stone, which had evidently formed
part of a very fine and rich building, as well as a
very ancient fragment of a red baked earthenware
water-pipe. Many of the pieces of marble in
the heap contained ornamentations such as successions
of the heart pattern, graceful curve scrolls
suggesting leaves, and also regular leaf patterns.
One stone was absolutely spherical, like a cannon
ball, and quite smooth; and some stone imple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-217" id="Pg_2-217"></a>[<a href="./images/2-217.png">217</a>]</span>ments,
such as a conical brown hammer and a
pestle, were very interesting.</p>

<p>On the white marble columns stood two
charming little oil lamps, of a most graceful
shape, in green earthenware, and in digging we
were fortunate enough to find a third, which is
now in my possession. They can be seen in the
illustration (facing page <a href="#Pg_2-218">218</a>), although I fear not
at their best, being so small. They were not unlike
the old Pompeian lamps in shape, and certainly
quite as graceful. The wick used to be lighted
at the spout.</p>

<p>Among other fragments was the capital of a
pillar, and portions of Koran inscriptions. As
we dug excitedly with our hands in the sand we
found other inscriptions on slate and on grey-stone,
of one of which I took an impression on
paper. It seemed much more ancient than the
others and had a most beautiful design on it of
curves and flowers.</p>

<p>A tablet at the entrance of the tomb of the
Forty Saints was not of marble but of slate
carved. It bore the following date: &#1777;&#1778;&#1784;&#1778; which
I believe corresponds to 1282. The heptagonal
tower had two entrances, one to the north, the
other to the south, but was, unfortunately,
getting smothered in sand again.</p>

<p>We became greatly excited on discovering the
inscriptions, and pulled up our sleeves and proceeded
in due haste to dig again in the sand&mdash;a process
which, although much dryer, reminded
one very forcibly of one's younger days at the
seaside. Our efforts were somewhat cooled by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-218" id="Pg_2-218"></a>[<a href="./images/2-218.png">218</a>]</span>
ghastly white marble figure which we dug up,
and which had such a sneering expression on its
countenance that it set the natives all round
shrieking with laughter.</p>

<p>We thought we had better leave off. Moreover,
the natives who had accompanied us
seemed rather upset at my photographing and
digging, and now that I had got what I wanted
I did not care to make them feel more uneasy
than was necessary. I had exhausted all the
photographic plates I had brought out with me,
night was coming on fast, and we had twenty
miles to ride back. On my last plate I photographed
our last find, which is reproduced for
the benefit of my readers facing page <a href="#Pg_2-218">218</a>.</p>

<p>This ugly head, with a very elongated and
much expanded nose and a vicious mouth full of
teeth, had been carved at the end of a piece of
marble one and a half feet high. The head, with
its oblique eyes, was well polished, but the
remainder of the marble beyond the ears, which
were just indicated by the artist, was roughly
cut and appeared to have been made with the
intention of being inserted into a wall, leaving
the head to project outside. Its flat forehead,
too, would lead to the conclusion that it had been
so shaped to act as a support, very likely to some
tablet, or moulding of the mosque.</p>

<p>The Katkhuda said that it was a very ancient
god, but its age was not easy to ascertain on so
short an acquaintance. It certainly seemed
very much more ancient than anything else we
had found and inspected at Zaidan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not for me to go fully into the history of
this great city of Zaidan, for so much of it rests
on speculation and confused traditions that I
would rather leave this work to some scientist
of a more gambling disposition than my own;
but now that I have described what I myself
saw I will add a few historical details which
seem correct, and the opinions of one or two
other travellers in that region which add interest
to the place as well as strengthen my statements.
With the many photographs which I took and
which are reproduced in this book, I hope that
a fair idea of the place will be conveyed to the

<p>The following short historical notes were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-220" id="Pg_2-220"></a>[<a href="./images/2-220.png">220</a>]</span>
furnished to me by the Katkhuda (or head
village man) of the present village near the
Zaidan ruins. I reproduce them verbatim,
without assuming any responsibility for the accuracy
of the historical dates, but the information
about the great city itself I found to be correct.</p>

<p class="illc">Arabic Inscription on Marble dug by Author at the City of Zaidan.</p>

<p>When Shah Rukh Shah was ruler of
Turkistan, and one Malek Kutuh-ud-din was
ruler of Sistan and Kain, Shah Rukh Shah was
engaged in settling disturbances in the northern
part of his dominions, and <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Melek'">Malek</ins> Kutuh-ud-din,
taking advantage of it, attacked Herat and
plundered it. Shah Rukh Shah, hearing of this,
collected an army and marched on Sistan.
During this march he devastated the country,
which was then very fertile and wealthy, and
captured and dispersed the inhabitants of the
endless city of Zaidan&mdash;which extended from
Kala-i-Fath, to the south (now in Afghan
territory on the present bank of the Halmund),
to Lash Yuwain on the north (also in Afghan
territory on the bank of the Farah Rud), a
distance, according to the Trigonometrical
Survey Maps, of 86 miles as the crow flies.
This would agree with the account given me by
the Amir of the extent of the city.</p>

<p>The city of Zaidan was protected by a large
fortress at every six farsakhs (24 miles). Each
fortress was said to be strongly garrisoned with
troops, and had a high watch tower in the
centre similar to that which I saw at a distance
on the north-east of Iskil, and which has been
described in previous pages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-221" id="Pg_2-221"></a>[<a href="./images/2-221.png">221</a>]</span></p>

<p>Another historical version attributes the
destruction of Zaidan and adjoining cities to
Taimur Lang (Tamerlane) or Taimur the lame
(<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 736-785), father of Shah Rukh
whose barbarous soldiery, as some traditions will
have it, were alone responsible for the pillage of
Zaidan city and the devastation of all Sistan.
The name of Taimur Lang is to this day held in
terror by the natives of Sistan.</p>

<p>But whether Zaidan was devastated twice, or
whether the two accounts apply to the same
disaster, it is not easy to ascertain at so distant a
date. There are obvious signs all over Eastern
Sistan that the country must have undergone
great trouble and changes&mdash;probably under
the rule of Shah Rukh and his successors (<span class="smcap">a.h.</span>
853-873), after which revolutions seem to have
been rampant for some sixty years, until Shah
Ismail Safavi conquered Khorassan and the
neighbouring countries, founding a powerful
dynasty which reigned up to the year <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 1135.</p>

<p>Under the Safavi dynasty Sistan seems to have
been vested in the Kayani Maliks, who are
believed to be descendants of the royal house of
Kai. (I came across a village chief claiming to
be the descendant of these Kayani rulers.)</p>

<p>To return to the Zaidan ruins, as seen to-day
from the highest point of the citadel wall, the
ruined city stretches in a curve from north to
south-east. It is to the south-east that the ruins
are less covered with sand and in better preservation,
the citadel standing about half way between
its former north and southern termini. There is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-222" id="Pg_2-222"></a>[<a href="./images/2-222.png">222</a>]</span>
every evidence to show that the present extensive
ruins of Peshawaran to the north, Pulki,
Deshtak (Doshak described by Bellew) and
Nad-i-Ali were at one epoch merely a continuation
of Zaidan the great city, just as Westminster,
South Kensington, Hammersmith, &amp;c., are the
continuation of London, and make it to-day the
largest conglomeration of houses in the world.
It was evidently necessary to subdivide such an
enormous place into districts.</p>

<p>Bellew, who visited the ruins in 1872, speaks
of Zaidan as "extending as far as the eye can
reach to the north-east, and said to be continuous
with the ruins of Doshak (Deshtak), about nine
miles from the Helmund. These ruins, with
those of Pulki, Nadali and Peshawaran, are the
most extensive in Sistan, and mark the sites of
populous cities, the like of which are not to be
found at this present day in all this region between
the Indus and the Tigris."</p>

<p>Doshak or Deshtak is situated about fourteen
miles south by south-east of Sher-i-Nasrya, on the
right bank of the main canal which extended
from the Halmund towards the west. It was a
large walled town, with towers and a square fort
in the centre. Deshtak is said to have been the
residence and capital of the first member of the
Safavi dynasty in Sistan, which, like all other
cities of Sistan, was pillaged and razed to the
ground by the terrible Taimur Lang. On its
ruins rose the smaller city of some 500 houses
which we have mentioned&mdash;also called Jalalabad&mdash;and
which eventually became the seat of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-223" id="Pg_2-223"></a>[<a href="./images/2-223.png">223</a>]</span>
Bahram Khan, the last of the Kayani chiefs.
The city was built by him for his son Jalaludin,
after whom it was named. Jalaludin, however,
was expelled from the throne, and from that date
the Kayani family ceased to reign in Sistan.</p>

<p>Pulki was also located on this main canal, east
of Deshtak, and Peshawaran was situated due
north of Zaidan. They consist of an immense
extent of ruins. Both Sir F. Goldsmid and
Bellew, who travelled in that part testify to the
whole country between Jalalabad, Buri-i-Afghan
and Peshawaran being covered with ruins.</p>

<p>The ruins at Peshawaran I was not able to
visit, they being in Afghan territory&mdash;now forbidden
to Englishmen&mdash;and, being the guest of
the British Consul, I did not wish to cause trouble.
Sir F. Goldsmid, who visited them during the
Perso-Afghan Frontier Mission, describes them
as covering a great area and being strongly
built of alternate layers of sun-burnt and baked
brick. The ruins of a madrassah, with a mosque
and a <i>mihrab</i>, were most extensive, and had traces
of ornamentations, and an inscription, said to be
Kufic. The walls of the citadel were (in 1872)
in fairly good repair. "The citadel," Sir F.
Goldsmid relates, "was of a circular form, somewhat
irregular in shape, with a diameter of from
two to three hundred yards. The walls are
about fifty feet high, built strongly of baked
brick, with a species of arched covered gallery,
five feet high and five feet wide, running round
the summit of the ramparts."</p>

<p>A very similar arrangement was to be seen on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-224" id="Pg_2-224"></a>[<a href="./images/2-224.png">224</a>]</span>
the Zaidan fort, as can be noticed in the photograph
which I took and which is reproduced in
the full page illustration (facing page <a href="#Pg_2-206">206</a>).</p>

<p>"Two massive round towers guard the gateway
approached by a narrow steep ascent. In
the centre of the fort on a mound stood a
superior house, probably the residence of the
Governor. To the south,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> dense drifts of sand
run to the summits of the ramparts."</p>

<p>If these drifts can rise so high on the high
wall of the citadel, it is certain that a great many
of the smaller buildings must be rather deep
under the sand level by now, but that they are
there, there can be little doubt, for fragments of
tiles, bricks, vases, &amp;c., strew the ground. No
doubt the usual critic will wonder how it is that,
if the houses are buried, these fragments are not
buried also. The wind principally is responsible
for their keeping on the surface of the sand.
They are constantly shifted and are blown from
place to place, until arrested by some obstacle
such as a wall, where a great number of these
fragments can generally be found collected by
the wind.</p>

<p>"The great characteristic of these ruins"&mdash;continues
Sir F. Goldsmid&mdash;"is the number
of accurately constructed arches which still
remain, and which are seen in almost every
house, and the remains of strongly built windmills,
with a vertical axis, as is usually the case
in Sistan."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-225" id="Pg_2-225"></a>[<a href="./images/2-225.png">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>This again, as we have seen, is also one of the
characteristics of the Zaidan buildings.</p>

<p>The ruins of Peshawaran are subdivided into
several groups, such as the Kol Marut, Saliyan,
three miles east of the fort, Khushabad, Kalah-i-Mallahun,
Nikara-Khanah, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Bellew, who camped at Saliyan, describes this
section of the ruins "which cover many square
miles of country, with readily distinguishable
mosques and colleges (madrassahs), and the Arabic
inscriptions traceable on the fa&ccedil;ades of some of
the principal buildings clearly refer their date to
the period of the Arab conquest, and further, as
is evidenced by the domes and arches forming
the roofs of the houses, that then, as now, the
country was devoid of timber fit for building
purposes. The most remarkable characteristic
of these ruins is their vast extent and excellent
preservation."</p>

<p>I, too, am of Bellew's opinion about these
points. The several inscriptions I found at
Zaidan, photographs of which I have given in this
book, were, as we have seen, in Arabic; the
ornamentations of which I took tracings were
Arabic in character.</p>

<p>Bellew reckons the great extent of the Peshawaran
section of the ruins as covering an area
of about six miles by eight. He states that
they were the outgrowths of successive cities
rising on the ruins of their predecessors upon
the same spot, and, like the other few travellers
who have intelligently examined the ruins, came
to the conclusion that in point of architecture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-226" id="Pg_2-226"></a>[<a href="./images/2-226.png">226</a>]</span>
and age the whole length from Lash Yuwain to
the north to Kala-i-Fath to the south, and including
Peshawaran, Zaidan and Kali-i-Fath were
absolutely identical.</p>

<p>Goldsmid supplies information similar to
Bellew's regarding the Peshawaran ruins, and he
writes that on his march north to Lash Yuwain
he had to go three or four miles to the west on
account of the ruins. He speaks of seeing a
place of worship with a <i>mihrab</i>, and, curiously
enough, on the wall above it he found "the
masonic star of five points surrounded by a circle
and with a round cup between each of the points
and another in the centre." He also saw the
tomb of Saiyid Ikbal, also mentioned by another
traveller, Christie.</p>

<p>Eight miles west by north-west from the ruins
rises a flat-topped plateau-like hill, called the
Kuh-i-Kuchah, not dissimilar in shape to the
Kuh-i-Kwajah to the south-west of Sher-i-Nasrya.
Four villages are found near it. To
the east of it is found the Farah Rud, and to its
west the Harut Rud,&mdash;two rivers losing themselves
(when they have any water in them)
into the lagoon. The Harut is not always
flowing. To the south is the Naizar lagoon
forming part of the Hamun-Halmund. (This
lagoon was mostly dry when I went through.)
It has formed a huge lake at various epochs, but
now only the northern portion, skirting the
southern edge of the Peshawaran ruins, has
any permanent water in it, and is principally
fed by the delta of canals and by the overflow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-227" id="Pg_2-227"></a>[<a href="./images/2-227.png">227</a>]</span>
of the Halmund, over the Band, a kind of
barrage.</p>

<p>Some explanation is necessary to make things
clear.</p>

<p>On the present Afghan-Perso boundary, at a
place called the "Band-i-Sistan," is the great
dam across the Halmund, completely turning the
waters of the stream, by means of semi-artificial
canals, for the irrigation of Sistan. Hence
the fertility of that district. The dam, "the
Band," as it is called by the natives, is a barrier
slightly over 700 feet long, constructed of upright
wooden stakes holding in position
horizontal fascines of tamarisk interwoven,
strengthened by stones and plastered with mud
to form a semi-solid wall. In olden days the
Band was so feebly constructed that it was
generally carried away every year at the spring
floods, but now greater attention is given to its
construction and it is kept in fairly good repair,
although portions of it usually collapse or are
carried away by the force of the current during
the floods. The height of the Band is not more
than eighteen or twenty feet. Practically the
actual river course comes to an end at this Band,
and from this point its waters are spread into
a delta of canals, large and small, subdivided
into hundreds other tortuous channels. The
Hussein Ki Canal is one of the most important,
and feeds Zaidan, Iskil, Bunjar and Sher-i-Nasrya,
Husseinabad, and other places, and is
subdivided into minor channels during its course.
It flows roughly in a north-west direction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-228" id="Pg_2-228"></a>[<a href="./images/2-228.png">228</a>]</span></p>

<p>In 1896, according to Major Sykes (<i>Royal
Geographical Society's Journal</i>), a new canal,
known as the Rud-i-Perian, was formed, and
destroyed Jahanabad, Ibrahimabad and Jalalabad.
This canal, he says, is not far from the
Rud-i-Nasru, which he seems to think was at
one time the main stream and flowed in a
natural bed past Zaidan to the west of it, but
personally I have my doubts about the accuracy
of this statement. I believe that the Rud-i-Nasru
was merely a shallow canal that passed
to the west of Zaidan, but that the river course
of the Halmund itself was always to the east of
Zaidan as well as of the other adjoining cities
north of Zaidan. The Canal to the east of
Nad-i-Ali is no doubt a naturally cut channel,
the obvious continuation under natural circumstances
of the river course. The same remark
might apply to the small channel self-cut to
the west of that place. There are other important
channels, such as the Madar-Ab, which
supplies water to Chiling, Pulki and Sekhuka;
the Kimak canal and the Kasimabad. Before
the present dam was constructed some eighty
years ago, a previous "Band" existed, as we
shall see, further up the course of the Halmund
to the south, and secured the irrigation of the
southern portion of Sistan, which is now absolutely
dry and barren. Dried up canal beds of great
length are still to be found in southern Sistan.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-048.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-048_th.jpg" alt="Sketch Plan of Zaidan Citadel" title="Sketch Plan of Zaidan Citadel" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Sketch Plan of "<span class="smcap">Zaidan Citadel</span>"</p>
<p class="figcenter">by</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">A. Henry Savage Landor.</span></p>

<p>It would be a great undertaking to describe
accurately all these canals and the various
positions they have occupied at different epochs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-229" id="Pg_2-229"></a>[<a href="./images/2-229.png">229</a>]</span>
and the task would at best be most thankless
and useless, for, with the exception of the larger
ones, the minor ones keep constantly changing
their course by cutting themselves new beds in
the soft soil. Anybody who has visited eastern
Sistan, even in a very dry season, as I did,
knows too well how the ground is intersected
in all directions by myriads of natural water
channels, all fed by the Halmund, so that, unless
one had months of time at one's disposal, it
would hardly be possible to map them all out
exactly.</p>

<p>During flood time the water flows over the
Band and into its natural channel due north up
into the Hamun, where it loses itself.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of verdure, trees, and
high reeds near the banks of the river at the
Band, with many snakes, while fish is plentiful
in the water and myriads of wild fowl are to be
seen.</p>

<p>Curious conical temporary graves of mud can
occasionally be seen, some six feet high, the body
being, it is said, buried standing within these
cones previous to proper interment with due
ceremony. On the outside, clear imprints made
while the mud was still soft of several sized
hands&mdash;presumably of the deceased's relations or
friends&mdash;were left on the surface of the cone,
the imprints being one above the other in
a line.</p>

<p>Among the ruins of Peshawaran, Bellew found
traces of several canals, now dry, one of which,
however, had been restored by the chief of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-230" id="Pg_2-230"></a>[<a href="./images/2-230.png">230</a>]</span>
Hokat and brought a stream of good water up
to the Silyan ruins for irrigation purposes.</p>

<p>As for the southern end of the great city at
Kala-i-Fath, we have very good accounts from
Ferrier, Goldsmid, and Bellew, all testifying
to its great extent. Here, too, there is a strong
citadel standing on an artificial mound, and
seeming to have been repaired some twenty-five
or thirty years ago. Bellew says that the ruins
extend over several miles of country, and Goldsmid
speaks of a circumference of ruins of some
two and a half miles at Kala-i-Fath, with a large
citadel and fine arched buildings within. He
mentions spacious courtyards and the remains of
reservoirs, caravanserais, and large buildings in
abundance, but no vestige of anything approaching
magnificence.</p>

<p>This, however, is the case with everything
Persian, whether ancient or modern, especially
in regard to architecture, and a great deal of
the humbleness of the buildings is, I think, due
to the facts that the inhabitants of Persia are
nomads by nature; that the shifting sands drive
people from their homes; that rivers constantly
alter their courses, and that the water supply is
a constant source of difficulty in most parts of
Iran; moreover the terrible wars and invasions
made the natives disinclined to construct themselves
very elaborate houses which they might
at any moment have to abandon.</p>

<p>These reasons account for the extraordinary
number of abandoned villages, towns, fortresses,
and whole ruined suburbs of towns all over Persia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-231" id="Pg_2-231"></a>[<a href="./images/2-231.png">231</a>]</span>
a sight which I think cannot be seen on such a
large scale in any other country in the world.</p>

<p>At Kala-i-Fath the question of the water may
not have been the principal one, but the fear of
constant attacks must have deterred the natives
from erecting magnificent buildings. Or else
how could we account for these enormous
fortresses which are found all along to protect
the great city?</p>

<p>Goldsmid describes a fine caravanserai at
Kala-i-Fath, built of large baked bricks, each
brick eleven inches square, and displaying a
nicety of design foreign to Sistan. The caravanserai
seems to have been domed over a large
central courtyard, with wings for rooms and
stabling; and an adjoining ice-house of mud
bricks. In the graveyard fragments of alabaster
and tiles were found.</p>

<p>The wall round the city which Goldsmid
describes&mdash;six feet at the base tapering to one
foot at the summit&mdash;is somewhat different in
character from that of Zaidan, and is, to my
mind, of much later construction, as are many
of the buildings.</p>

<p>"Some of the streets," he says, "which all
run from east to west, are in excellent preservation
and as if they were of recent construction."</p>

<p>It is quite possible, in fact, very probable,
that this portion of the great city&mdash;which, by
the bye, is said to have been the last capital of
the Kayani Kings, and was deserted by them
when attacked by Nadir Shah&mdash;has, owing to
its favourable geographical position on the east<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-232" id="Pg_2-232"></a>[<a href="./images/2-232.png">232</a>]</span>
bank of the Halmund, been inhabited to a
certain extent until a much later date. The
local accounts, at least, would point to that
conclusion.</p>

<p>A dry canal exists, which we shall cross on
our way to the Beluchistan frontier; it is fed by
the Halmund, north of Kala-i-Fath, and strikes
across the plain in a westerly direction.</p>

<p>If all the accounts given by people who have
been there are taken into consideration, together
with the photographs here given, which seem
to me to show that the place was one of unusual
grandeur; if the fact is grasped that, whether
considered as a single city or a conglomeration
of adjoining successive cities, Zaidan was undoubtedly
a continuous and uninterrupted row
of houses of no less than eighty-six miles; I
think that whatever theories may be expounded
by the usual scientific speculator at home, the
fact must remain that this ancient London of
Asia marks a period of astounding prosperity in
the history of Eastern Persia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Owing</span> to the tender care of Major and Mrs.
Benn I was, at the beginning of 1902, in a fair
condition of strength to undertake the journey of
600 miles on camels across Northern Beluchistan
to Quetta. With the help of Major Benn I
made up a fresh caravan entirely of running
camels, and expected therefore to be able to
travel very fast. The camels selected were excellent,
and the two Beluch drivers who came
with me most faithful, considerate and excellent
servants. Sadek also accompanied me.</p>

<p>Everything was made ready to start by
January 2nd, but some hitch or other occurred
daily, and it was not till January 10th that I was
able to take my departure&mdash;sorry indeed to say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-234" id="Pg_2-234"></a>[<a href="./images/2-234.png">234</a>]</span>
good-bye to my new good friends, Major and
Mrs. Benn, to whose charmingly thoughtful
care I altogether owed it that I was now able
to proceed in good health.</p>

<p>The hour of our departure was fixed for
5 o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, but my three cats, suspecting
that we were going to move from our comfortable
quarters, disappeared during the night, and
some hours were wasted by Sadek and all the
servants of the Consulate in trying to find them
again. I was determined not to start without
them. Sadek was furious, the camel men impatient,
the guard of Lancers sent by the Consul
to accompany me for some distance had been
ready on their horses for a long time, and everybody
at hand was calling out "Puss, puss, puss!"
in the most endearing tones of voice, and searching
every possible nook.</p>

<p>After four hours of expressive language in
Persian, Hindustani, Beluchi and English, at
nine o'clock the cats were eventually discovered.
One had hidden under a huge pile of wood, all
of which we had to remove to get him out; the
second had found a most comfortable sanctum in
Mrs. Benn's room, and the third, having ascertained
that his companions had been discovered,
walked out unconcerned and entered the travelling
box of his own accord.</p>

<p>I was sorry to leave Sistan too, with its ancient
ruins, its peculiar inhabitants, a mixture of all
kinds, its quaint city, so strikingly picturesque
especially at sunset, when, owing to the moisture
in the air, beautiful warm colours appeared in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-235" id="Pg_2-235"></a>[<a href="./images/2-235.png">235</a>]</span>
the sky, and the thousands of camels, and sheep,
moving like so many phantoms in clouds of dust,
returned to their homes. The sad dingling of
their bells sounded musical enough in the
distance, and one saw horsemen dashing full
gallop towards the city before the gates were
closed, every man carrying a gun. Far to the
west in the background stood the Kuh-i-Kwajah
mountain, so famous in the history of Sistan.
All this after the dreary, long Salt Desert journey
had seemed heavenly to me, and I was more than
sorry to leave the place.</p>

<p>Had I been a Russian instead of an Englishman
I would not have continued my journey on
the morning of my departure, for on coming out
of the Consulate gate the first thing I saw was a
dead body being washed and prepared for interment
by relatives in the dead-house adjoining
the Consulate wall. The Russians believe the
sight of a dead body an ill-omen at the beginning
of a journey.</p>

<p>Gul Khan, the Consul's assistant, accompanied
me as far as the Kuh-i-Kwajah mountain,
to inspect which I had to make a detour.</p>

<p>We passed south of Sher-i-Nasrya, and, after
wading through numberless water channels and
skirting large pools of water, crossed a tiny
anonymous village of six domed huts, and then
came to a very large one rejoicing in the name
of Dadi. My fast camels carrying loads had
gone ahead, and we, who had started later on
horses, caught them up some sixteen miles onward,
where there was a third little village, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-236" id="Pg_2-236"></a>[<a href="./images/2-236.png">236</a>]</span>
inhabitants of which were wild-looking and
unkempt. The women and children stampeded
at our approach. The houses were flat-topped
and were no taller than seven feet, except the
house of the head village man which was two-storeyed
and had a domed roof.</p>

<p>When the Hamun Halmund extended as far
south as Kandak the Kuh-i-Kwajah mountain
was an island, but now the whole country around
it is dry except some small swamps and pools,
on the edges of which thousands of sheep could
be seen grazing. It took a very powerful sight
indeed to see what the animals were grazing on.
One's idea of a pasture&mdash;we always picture a
pasture for sheep as green&mdash;was certainly not
fulfilled, and after a minute inspection one saw
the poor brutes feeding on tiny stumps of dried
grass, yellowish in colour and hardly distinguishable
from the sand on which it grew in clusters
not more than half an inch high.</p>

<p>Where the Hamun had been its bed was now
of a whitish colour from salt deposits.</p>

<p>The <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Kuk'">Kuh</ins>-i-Kwajah (mountain), occasionally
also called Kuh-i-Rustam, rising as it does
directly from the flat, is most attractive and
interesting, more particularly because of its
elongated shape and its flat top, which gives it
quite a unique appearance. Seen from the east,
it stretches for about three miles and a half or
even four at its base, is 900 feet high, and about
three miles on top of the plateau. The summit,
even when the beholder is only half a mile away
from it, appears like a flat straight line against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-237" id="Pg_2-237"></a>[<a href="./images/2-237.png">237</a>]</span>
the sky-line, a great boulder that stands up
higher on the south-west being the only interruption
to this uniformity. The black rocky
sides of the mountain are very precipitous&mdash;in
fact, almost perpendicular at the upper portion,
but the lower part has accumulations of clay,
mud and sand extending in a gentle slope. In
fact, roughly speaking, the silhouette of the
mountain has the appearance of the section of an
inverted soup-plate.</p>

<p class="illc">silhouette of kuh-i-kwajah.</p>

<p>Major Sykes, in the <i>Royal Geographical
Society's Journal</i>, describes this mountain as
resembling in shape "an apple," but surely if
there ever was anything in the world that had
no resemblance whatever to "an apple" it was
this mountain. It would be curious to know
what Major Sykes calls "an apple."</p>

<p>The diagram here appended of the outline of
the mountain, and indeed the photograph given
by Major Sykes in the <i>Royal Geographical
Society's Journal</i>, February, 1902, page 143, will,
I think, be sufficient to convince the least
observant on this point. Major Sykes is also no
less than 500 feet out in his estimate of the
height of the hill. The summit is 900 feet
above the plain&mdash;not 400 feet as stated by him.</p>

<p>The altitude at the base is 2,050 feet, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-238" id="Pg_2-238"></a>[<a href="./images/2-238.png">238</a>]</span>
the summit 2,950 feet. As we rounded the
mountain to the southward to find a place at
which we could climb to the top, we saw a very
ancient fort perched on the summit of the
mountain commanding the ruins of Kala-i-Kakaha,
or the "city of roars of laughter,"&mdash;a
quaint and picturesque city built on the
steep slope of the south escarpment of the
mountain.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Sketch Map</p>

<p class="figcenter">of Summit of Kuh-i-Kwajah</p>

<p class="figcenter">by A. Henry Savage Landor.</p>

<p>In the centre of this city was a large and high
quadrangular wall like a citadel, and it had
houses all round it, as can be seen by the
bird's-eye view photograph I took of it from
the fort above, a view from which high point
of vantage will be described at the end of this
chapter.</p>

<p>We went along the outer wall of the city on
a level with the plain at the hill's base, but we
abandoned it as this wall went up the mountain
side to the north. Some high columns could be
seen, which appeared to have formed part of a
high tower. The sides of the hill on which
the city was built were very precipitous, but a
steep tortuous track existed, leading to the city
on the east side, the two gates of the city being
situated&mdash;one north-east, the other north-west&mdash;in
the rear of the city, and, as it were, facing
the mountain side behind. On the south-west
side high accumulations of sand formed an
extensive tongue projecting very far out into the
plain.</p>

<p>The rocky upper portion of the Kuh-i-Kwajah
mountain was black towards the east, but getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-239" id="Pg_2-239"></a>[<a href="./images/2-239.png">239</a>]</span>
yellowish in the southern part, where there were
high sand accumulations up to about three-quarters
of the height of the mountain, with
deep channels cut into them by water.</p>

<p>We came to a narrow gorge which divides the
mountain in two, and by which along a very
stony path between high vertical rocks the
summit of the table mountain could be reached.
We left our horses in charge of a lancer and
Mahommed Azin, the head village man of Deh-i-Husena&mdash;a
man who said he was a descendant
of the Kayani family, and who professed to know
everything about everything,&mdash;Gul Khan and I
gradually climbed to the higher part of the
mountain. I say "gradually" because there was
a great deal to interest and puzzle one on the
way up.</p>

<p>This path to the summit had been formerly
strongly fortified. Shortly after entering the
gorge, where we had dismounted, was a strange
wall cut in the hard, flint-like rock by a very
sharp, pointed instrument. One could still
distinctly see the narrow grooves made by it.
Then there were curious heads of the same rock
with side hollows that looked as if caused by the
constant friction or some horizontal wooden or
stone implement. I was much puzzled by these
and could not come to a definite conclusion of
what could have been their use. Even our
guide's universal knowledge ran short; he
offered no explanation beyond telling me that
they had been made by man, which I had long
before discovered for myself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-240" id="Pg_2-240"></a>[<a href="./images/2-240.png">240</a>]</span></p>

<p>A small reservoir for rain-water was found
near this spot, and nearly at the top of the
hillock a ditch had been excavated near the
easiest point of access, and another ditch could
be seen all round. The low land round the
mountain has most certainly been inundated
at various epochs, forming a shallow, temporary
swamp, but not a permanent lake as has
been asserted by some, and from what one
saw one was tempted to believe that the plain
around Kuh-i-Kwajah must have been dryer in
the days of its glory than it has been in this
century.</p>

<p class="illc">A Family Tomb (Eight Compartments) on Kuh-i-Kwajah.</p>

<p>On reaching the summit we found ourselves
on an undulating plateau covered with graves,
but these graves, unlike all others which I had
seen in Persia, had not only the characteristic
points of the Zaidan ones in which the body was
encased in the tomb above the level of the
ground, but were in compartments and contained
whole families. The first grave we examined
was made of huge boulders and was six yards
long, four yards wide and had four sections, each
occupied by a skeleton and covered over with
flat slabs of stone. Each compartment was
about 1&frac12; feet high, 2&frac12; feet broad, and 6 feet
long. Near this family grave was a quarry of
good stone from which stones for grinding wheat,
hand-mortars, &amp;c., had been cut. At the foot
was a reservoir for rain-water.</p>

<p>One was rather surprised on reaching the
summit of Kuh-i-Kwajah to find it so undulating,
for on approaching the mountain from the plain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-241" id="Pg_2-241"></a>[<a href="./images/2-241.png">241</a>]</span>
one was specially impressed by its straight upper
outlines against the sky. The summit is actually
concave, like a basin, with numerous hillocks all
round, and one portion, judging by sediments left,
would appear to have contained a lake. In the
centre of the plateau are two extensive artificial
camps dug into the earth and rock, and having
stone sides. On a hillock to the west of one of
these ponds stands a tomb with no less than ten
graves side by side.</p>

<p>From this point eastwards, however, is the
most interesting portion of this curious plateau.
Numerous groups of graves are to be seen at
every few yards, and two dead-houses, one with
a large dome partly collapsed on the north
side, the other still in the most perfect state of
preservation. The photograph facing page <a href="#Pg_2-240">240</a>
gives a good idea of them. The larger and
more important dead-house had a central hall
4&frac12; yards square, and each side of the square
had an outer wing, each with one door and one
window above it. Each wing projected three
yards from the central hall. To the east in the
central hall there was a very greasy stone, that
looked as if some oily substance had been deposited
on it, possibly something used in preparing
the dead. Next to it was a vessel for
water.</p>

<p>Outside, all round the walls of this dead-house,
and radiating in all directions, were graves, all
above ground and as close together as was possible
to construct them, while on the hillocks to
the south of the dead-houses were hundreds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-242" id="Pg_2-242"></a>[<a href="./images/2-242.png">242</a>]</span>
compartments for the dead, some in perfect condition,
others fallen through; some showing
evident signs of having been broken through by
sacrilegious hands&mdash;very likely in search of
treasure.</p>

<p class="illc">The "Gandun Piran" Ziarat on Kuh-i-Kwajah.</p>

<p>On the top of a hillock higher than the others
was a tomb of thirty-eight sections, all occupied.
A lot of large stones were heaped on the top of
this important spot, and surmounting all and
planted firmly in them was a slender upright
stone pillar 6&frac12; feet high. It had no inscription
upon it nor any sign of any kind, and had been
roughly chipped off into an elongated shape.
Near this grave, which was the most extensive
of its kind that I had observed on the plateau,
was a very peculiar ruined house with four
rooms, each four yards square, and each room
with two doors, and all the rooms communicating.
It was badly damaged. Its shape was
most unusual.</p>

<p>We then proceeded to the Ziarat, a pilgrimage
place famous all over Persia and south-western
Afghanistan. I was fortunate enough to take a
good photograph of its exterior (see opposite),
which will represent its appearance to the reader
better than a description. A high rectangular
building plastered all over with mud, a front arch
or alcove giving access to a small door, and two
domed low stone buildings, one on either side,
and another ruined building with a wall around
it behind the Ziarat. A few yards to the left
of the entrance as one looked at it was a coarse
upright stone pillar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-243" id="Pg_2-243"></a>[<a href="./images/2-243.png">243</a>]</span></p>

<p>The inside of the Ziarat was more interesting
than the outside. It was a very large whitewashed
single room, with high vaulted ceiling,
and in the centre rose from the floor to a height
of three feet a gigantic tomb, six yards in length,
with a gabled top. It measured one yard and a
half across at the head, and one yard at its foot,
and had two stone pillars some five feet high
standing one at each extremity. To these two
end pillars was tied a rope, from which hung
numberless rags, strips of cloth and hair. Behind
the head of the tomb along the wall stretched a
platform four and a half feet wide, on which
rested two brass candlesticks of primitive shape,
a much-used kalyan, and a great number of rags
of all sizes, ages, and degrees of dirt.</p>

<p>The scrolls and inscriptions on the wall were
very quaint, primitive representations of animals
in couples, male and female, being the most
indulged in by the pilgrims. Goats and dogs
seemed favourite subjects for portrayal.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-055.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-055_th.jpg" alt="male and female goats. dog." title="male and female goats. dog." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">male and female goats.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;dog.</p>

<p>A lock of human hair and another of goat's
hair hung on the wall to the right of the
entrance, and on two sticks laid across, another
mass of rags, white, blue, yellow and red.
Hundreds more were strewn upon the ground,
and the cross bars of the four windows of the
Ziarat were also choke-full of these cloth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-244" id="Pg_2-244"></a>[<a href="./images/2-244.png">244</a>]</span>
offerings. Among other curious things noticeable
on the altar platform were a number of
stones scooped into water-vessels.</p>

<p>This Ziarat goes by the name of Gandun
Piran, and is said to be some centuries old. In
the spring equinox pilgrimages are made to this
Ziarat from the neighbouring city and villages,
when offerings of wheat are contributed that the
donor may be at peace with the gods and expect
plentiful crops. These pilgrimages take very
much the form of our "day's outing on a Bank
Holiday," and sports of various kinds are
indulged in by the horsemen. It is the custom
of devout people when visiting these Ziarats to
place a stone on the tomb, a white one, if
obtainable, and we shall find this curious custom
extending all over Beluchistan and, I believe,
into a great portion of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Directly in front of the Ziarat was the priests'
house, with massive, broad stone walls and nine
rooms. The ceilings, fallen through in most
rooms, were not semi-spherical as usual but
semi-cylindrical, as could still be seen very
plainly in the better-preserved one of the central
room. This house had a separate building
behind for stables and an outer oven for baking
bread. The dwelling was secluded by a wall.</p>

<p>The top of Kuh-i-Kwajah is even now a
favourite spot for people to be laid to their
eternal rest, and near this Ziarat were to be
found a great many graves which were quite
modern. These modern tombs, more elaborate
than the old ones, rose to about five feet above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-245" id="Pg_2-245"></a>[<a href="./images/2-245.png">245</a>]</span>
ground, had a mud and stone perforated balustrade
above them all round, and three steps by which
the upper part could be reached. They seldom,
however, had more than three bodies in each
tomb.</p>

<p>We found on the ground a very curious
large hollowed stone like a big mortar, which
seemed very ancient. Then further were more
old graves in rows of five, six, eight, and more.
When one peeped into the broken ones, the
temptation to take home some of the bleached
skulls to add to the collection of one's national
museum, and to let scientists speculate on their
exact age, was great. But I have a horror of
desecrating graves. I took one out&mdash;a most
beautifully preserved specimen&mdash;meaning to
overcome my scruples, but after going some
distance with it wrapped up in my handkerchief
I was seized with remorse, and I had to go and
lay it back again in the same spot where it had
for centuries lain undisturbed.</p>

<p>I examined several skulls that were in good
condition, and the following were their principal
characteristics. They possessed abnormally
broad cheek-bones, and the forehead was very
slanting backwards and was extremely narrow
across the temples and broad at its highest
portion. The back portion of the skull, in
which the animal qualities of the brain are said
by phrenologists to reside, was also abnormally
developed, when compared to European skulls.
The top section (above an imaginary plane
intersecting it horizontally above the ear) was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-246" id="Pg_2-246"></a>[<a href="./images/2-246.png">246</a>]</span>
well formed, except that in the back part there
was a strange deep depression on the right side
of the skull, and an abnormal development on
the left side. This peculiarity was common to a
great many skulls, and was their most marked
characteristic. Evidently the brains of the
people who owned them must have constantly
been working on a particular line which caused
this development more than that of other
portions of the skull.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-056.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-056_th.jpg" alt="A Bird's Eye View of Kala-i-Kakaha, the City of Roars of Laughter." title="A Bird's Eye View of Kala-i-Kakaha, the City of Roars of Laughter." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">A Bird's Eye View of Kala-i-Kakaha, the "City of Roars of Laughter."</p>

<p>The upper jaw was rather contracted and
mean as compared to the remaining characteristics
of the skull, slanting very far forwards where it
ended into quite a small curve in which the front
teeth were set. The teeth themselves were
extremely powerful and healthy. The bumps
behind the ear channels were well marked.</p>

<p>The whole skull, however, as seen from above,
was more fully developed on its right side than
on the left; also the same abnormal development
on the right side could be noticed under the
skull at the sides, where it joins the spinal
column. In a general way these skulls reminded
one of the formation of the skulls of the present
Beluch.</p>

<p>Another smaller Ziarat partly ruined was to be
found south of the one we had inspected, the
tomb itself being of less gigantic proportions,
and now almost entirely buried in sand. The
two end pillars, however, remained standing upright,
the northern one being, nevertheless,
broken in half. The door of this Ziarat was to
the south of the building, and had a window<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-247" id="Pg_2-247"></a>[<a href="./images/2-247.png">247</a>]</span>
above it. The walls had a stone foundation,
some 2 feet high, above which the remainder
of the wall was entirely of mud, with a perforated
window to the west. The tomb itself was
8 feet long by 4 feet wide. A small square
receptacle was cut in the northern wall.</p>

<p>We had now come to the Kuk fort above the
city of Kala-i-Kakaha on the south of the mountain.
With the exception of a large round
tower, 40 feet in diameter at the base, there
remained very little to be seen of this strong-hold.
Sections of other minor towers and a
wall existed, but all was a confused mass of debris,
sand and mud.</p>

<p>From this point a splendid view was obtained
of the city of Kala-i-Kakaha just below, of which
a photograph from this bird's eye aspect will be
found facing p. <a href="#Pg_2-246">246</a> of this volume. There was
an extensive courtyard in the centre enclosed by a
high wall, and having a tower in the centre of
each of the two sides of the quadrangle. A belt
of buildings was enclosed between this high wall
and a second wall, which had two towers, one at
each angle looking north towards the cliff of the
mountain from which we observed. Outside
this wall two rows of what, from our high point
of vantage, appeared to be graves could be seen,
while to the east were other buildings and cliff
dwellings extending almost to the bottom of the
hill, where a tower marked the limit of the city.</p>

<p>From this point a tortuous track could be
seen along the gorge winding its way to the city
gate, the only opening in the high third wall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-248" id="Pg_2-248"></a>[<a href="./images/2-248.png">248</a>]</span>
most irregularly built along the precipice of the
ravine. At the foot of the mountain this wall
turned a sharp corner, and describing roughly a
semicircle protected the city also to the west.</p>

<p>At the most north-westerly point there seemed
to be the principal gate of the city, with a
massive high tower and with a road encased
between two high walls leading to it. The
semicircle formed by the mountain behind,
which was of a most precipitous nature, was
enclosed at its mouth by a fourth outer wall,
with an inner ditch, making the fortress of Kala-i-Kakaha
practically impregnable.</p>

<p>The legend about Kala-i-Kakaha city furnished
me by the Sar-tip, through Gul Khan, was very
interesting.</p>

<p>In ancient days there was in that city a deep
well, the abode of certain godly virgins, to whom
people went from far and near for blessings.
Visitors used to stand listening near the well,
and if their prayers were accepted the virgins
laughed heartily, whereby the city gained the
name of Kaka-ha (roar of laughter). Silence on
the part of the sanctimonious maidens was a
sign that the prayers were not granted.</p>

<p>The Sistan historical authorities seem to think
this origin of the name plausible. There were,
however, other amusing, if less reliable legends,
such as the one our friend Mahommed Azin
gave me, which is too quaint to be omitted.</p>

<p>"In the time of Alexander the Great," he told
us, "Aristotles the famous had produced an
animal which he had placed in <i>a</i> fort" (<i>which</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-249" id="Pg_2-249"></a>[<a href="./images/2-249.png">249</a>]</span>
fort Mahommed Azin seemed rather vague
about). "Whoever gazed upon the animal was
seized with such convulsions of laughter that he
could not stop until he died.</p>

<p>"When Alexander was 'in the West' (<i>i.e.</i>
<i>maghreb zemin</i>)" continued Mahommed Azin,
"he had seen this wonderful 'animal of laughter'
produced by Aristotles, and some seventy or
eighty thousand soldiers had actually died of
laughter which they could not repress on seeing
it. Plato only, who was a wise man, devised a
ruse to overcome the terrible effects of looking at
the animal. He brought with him a looking-glass
which he placed in front of the brute, and, sure
enough, the demon, which had caused the
hilarious death of many others, in its turn was
seized by hysterical laughing at itself, and of
course could not stop and died too."</p>

<p>Mahommed Azin was somewhat uncertain
whether the animal itself had resided in the
fortress of the Kuh-i-Kwajah mountain, or
whether the owner of the animal had visited
the place, or whether the place had been named
merely in honour of the legend of the "animal of
laughter." All I can say is that when Mahommed,
with a grave face, had finished his inimitable story,
Gul Khan and I were also seized with such uncontrollable
fits of hilarity that, notwithstanding
our mournful surroundings of graves and dead-houses,
we, too, very nearly went to swell the
number of victims of Mahommed Azin's "animal
of laughter," although without the pleasure of
having made its personal acquaintance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-250" id="Pg_2-250"></a>[<a href="./images/2-250.png">250</a>]</span></p>

<p>Mahommed Azin positively finished us up
when he gravely added that it was most dangerous
to recount the legend he had told us for he had
known people die of laughter by merely listening
to it. There was some truth in that. We
nearly did, not only at the story but at the story-teller
himself!</p>

<p>Kala-i-Kakaha is a famous spot in Persian
history, for it is said that the great Persian hero
Rustam's first exploit was to capture this city
and slay its king <i>Kuk</i>, after whom the fort
standing above Kakaha is named. In more
modern days Kakaha, which, from ancient times,
had been a place of shelter for retreating princes
hard driven by the enemy, has become noteworthy
for its seven years' resistance to the
attacks of Nadir's troops, when the Kayani King
Malik-Fath, having abandoned his capital, Kala-i-Fath
had taken refuge in the impregnable
city of Kala-i-Kakaha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were benighted on the mountain and did
not reach the village of Deh-i-Husena till nearly
nine o'clock, our friend and guide having lost his
way in the dark and having taken us round the
country for a good many more miles than was
necessary. It is true the night was rather black
and it was not easy to see where the low mud-houses
of his village were.</p>

<p>The distance in a direct line from Deh-i-Husena
to the foot of the Kuh-i-Kwajah mountain
was 4 miles, and the village of Deh-i-Husena
was about 15 miles from Sher-i-Nasrya, the
village of Dadi we had passed being 9 miles off,
and Sanchuli 14&frac34; miles from the city and only
a quarter of a mile from Deh-i-Husena. To
the south of the latter village was Deh-i-Ali-Akabar.</p>

<p>We spent the night at Deh-i-Husena,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-252" id="Pg_2-252"></a>[<a href="./images/2-252.png">252</a>]</span>
Mahommed Azin, the head village man and guide,
being so entertaining in his conversation that he
kept us up till all hours of the morning. He
professed to be one of the only two surviving
members of the Kayani family which formerly
reigned over Sistan, his cousin being the other.
According to his words&mdash;which, however, could
not always claim to be models of accuracy&mdash;his
family had a good deal of power in Sistan up to
about forty years ago (1860). They were now
very poor.</p>

<p>Mahommed Azin had well-cut features and
bore himself like a man of superior birth, but he
was very bitter in his speech against fate and things
in general. It was, nevertheless, wonderful how
a man, living in a small village secluded from
everybody and everywhere, had heard of flying
machines, of submarine boats, of balloons that
<i>ferenghis</i> made. His ideas of them were rather
amusing, but he was very intelligent and quick
at grasping how they worked when I explained
to him. Surgery interested him intensely, and
after that politics. The Ruski and Inglis he was
sure would have a great deal of trouble over
Sistan. He could not quite make up his mind
as to which was the bigger nation. When he
heard Ruski's accounts of themselves he certainly
thought the Ruski were the greater
people, but when he listened to the Inglis and
what they could do he really believed they must
be stronger.</p>

<p>"Who do you think is the most powerful?"
he inquired of me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-253" id="Pg_2-253"></a>[<a href="./images/2-253.png">253</a>]</span></p>

<p>"Of course, the Inglis, without doubt."</p>

<p>"Then do you think that your king will grant
me a pension, so that I can live in luxury and
without working to the end of my days?"</p>

<p>"The king does not usually grant pensions to
lazy people. Pensions are granted to people who
have done work for the country."</p>

<p>"Well then, you see," exclaimed Mahommed
Azin, in thorough unreasonable Persian fashion,
"you say your king is greater than the Ruski
king, and he would not grant me a pension, I the
last of the Kayanis!" He was sure the Ruski
potentate would at once if he knew!</p>

<p>I left Husena at 9.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on January 11th,
striking south for Warmal. There were a good
many wretched villages in succession half a mile
or so apart from one another, such as Dubna,
Hasan-Jafa, Luftulla and Husena Baba. The
ground was covered with white salt which
resembled snow.</p>

<p>Husena Baba was quite a large and important
village. The inhabitants came out in great
force to greet us. Although wood was extremely
scarce at this village, nearly all the houses had
flat roofs supported on rough rafters. Matting
on a layer of reeds prevented the upper coating of
mud from falling through. I came <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accross'">across</ins>
several horses laden with bundles of long reeds
which they dragged behind them, and which
they had carried, probably from the Naizar,
where they were plentiful.</p>

<p>We had altered our course from south to east,
and here I parted with useful Gul Khan and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-254" id="Pg_2-254"></a>[<a href="./images/2-254.png">254</a>]</span>
escort, who had to return to the Consulate. I
mounted my riding camel and started off, this
time south-east, on my way to Warmal.</p>

<p>Again we saw thousands of sheep grazing on
the flat desert of dried mud and salt cracked in
innumerable places by the sun. Here and there
a close examination showed tiny tufts of dried
grass, some two inches in circumference, and not
more than half an inch tall, and at an average
distance of about ten feet from one another. It
was astounding to me that so many animals could
find sufficient nourishment for subsistence on so
scanty a diet, but although not very fat the sheep
seemed to be in pretty good condition.</p>

<p>To the west we had a high ridge of mountains&mdash;the
Patang Kuh&mdash;and between these mountains
and our track in the distance an extensive
marsh could be distinguished, with high reeds in
profusion near its humid banks.</p>

<p>To the east some miles off were Dolehtabad
(village), then Tuti and Sakawa, near Lutok.</p>

<p>South-east before us, and stretching for several
miles, a flat-topped plateau rose to no very great
height above the horizon, otherwise everything
was flat and uninteresting all around us. Some
very curious walls of black mud mixed with
organic matter, built to shelter sheep from the
fierce north winds while proceeding from one
village to another, can be seen in the <i>lut</i>. These
black dashes on the white expanse of salt
and sand have about the same effect on the
picturesqueness of the scenery as coarse scrawls
with a blunt pen on a fine page of <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'caligraphy'">calligraphy</ins>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-255" id="Pg_2-255"></a>[<a href="./images/2-255.png">255</a>]</span>
You see them here and there, scattered about,
all facing north, like so many black dashes in the
otherwise delicate tones of grey and white of the
soil.</p>

<p>When we had gone some miles on this flat,
hard stretch of ground, where the heat was
terrible, we had to make a detour round a large
marsh. Then beyond it stood five parallel banks
of sand, 25 feet high, with horizontal layers of
half-formed stone up to half the height of the
dunes. The dunes were about 200 yards apart.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we arrived at Warmal, where
water seemed plentiful and good. Here too, as
in the centre of most villages and towns of
Persia, a pond of stagnant filthy water could be
seen. The pond at Warmal was of unusually
ample proportions and extended through the
whole length of the village, which was built on
both sides of this dirty pond. Numerous canals
branched off from this main reservoir, and in
fact, had one had a little imagination, one might
have named this place the Venice of Sistan. At
sunset swarms of mosquitoes rose buzzing from
the putrid water, but from a picturesque point of
view the effect of the buildings reflected in the
yellow-greenish water was quite pretty.</p>

<p>To facilitate transit from one side of the
village to the other, a primitive bridge of earth
had been constructed across the pond, but as the
central portion of it was under water it was
necessary to remove one's foot-gear in order to
make use of the convenience.</p>

<p>Characteristic of Warmal were the quaint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-256" id="Pg_2-256"></a>[<a href="./images/2-256.png">256</a>]</span>
balconies or terraces, in shape either quadrangular
or rectangular, that were attached to or
in close proximity of each house. They were
raised platforms of mud from 2 to 4 feet above
the ground, with a balustrade of sun-burnt
bricks. On these terraces the natives seek
refuge during the summer nights to avoid being
suffocated by the stifling heat inside their houses.</p>

<p>A difference in the construction and architecture
of some of the roofs of the houses could
be noted here. The roofs were oblong instead
of perfectly circular, and when one examined
how the bricks were laid it seemed extraordinary
that the vaults stood up at all. These were the
only roofs in Persia I had seen constructed on
this particular principle.</p>

<p>The bricks were laid round the vaults for two-thirds
of the roof at an angle of 45&deg; and the
other third in a vertical position. There was
the usual upper central aperture and occasionally
one or two side ones.</p>

<p>The natives were very civil and obliging, and
as usual they all crowded round to converse.</p>

<p>"Sahib," said one old man, "you must come
to settle here."</p>

<p>"Why should I settle here?"</p>

<p>"It is very cheap to build houses at Warmal."</p>

<p>"How much does it cost to build a house?"</p>

<p>"Come and see and you will tell me whether
you can build a house cheaper in your country."</p>

<p>He took me to a spacious new residence,
14 feet by 14 feet inside, and 18 feet high.</p>

<p>"It is a fine house, is it not, Sahib?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-257" id="Pg_2-257"></a>[<a href="./images/2-257.png">257</a>]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, very fine."</p>

<p>"It cost me exactly two tomans, four krans
(about nine shillings) to build it, as it stands."</p>

<p>Enumerating the various items of expenditure
on the tips of his fingers:&mdash;"Sun-baked bricks
1 kran (5<i>d.</i>) per thousand," he continued;
"carpenter 1 kran a day for 5 days, and mason
1 kran a day. The people who helped were not
paid as they were relations!"</p>

<p>The dome of this house was very scientifically
constructed, as can be seen by the diagram, and
formed a very strong vault. To make these
vaults, four workmen begin at the four corners of
the quadrangular base to lay bricks in successively
enlarging concentric arcs of a circle,
each higher than the previous one, till each
section meets the two side ones. The small
portion that remains above is filled in with
bricks, laid transversely, and these vaults are
really of remarkable strength.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Semi-Spherical Roof, shewing how Bricks are laid.</p>

<p>I have seen some built on this principle, and
several centuries old, standing in good preservation
and as good as new.</p>

<p>The type of natives was quite different
again from that in other places already visited,
and was most interesting. The men, like most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-258" id="Pg_2-258"></a>[<a href="./images/2-258.png">258</a>]</span>
men of the desert, had elongated faces, with
long, regular noses, slightly convex and somewhat
drooping. The nostrils were rather
swollen and lacking character, and not sharply
cut. At the bridge the nose was very narrow,
but broad in its lower portion and quite rounded,
which looked better in profile than full face. The
nostrils drooped considerably towards the point
of the nose and were high up where joining the
cheek. The faces of these fellows formed a long
smooth oval with no marked cheek-bones and
vivid, dark, intelligent eyes, small but well-open,
showing the entire iris. The lips were the most
defective part of their faces, being unduly prominent,
thick and coarsely-shaped.</p>

<p>The hair grew in a very normal way on their
faces, and they possessed very good arched eyebrows,
slightly coarse but well-defined, and in
most cases meeting at the root of the nose. In
fully-formed men the beard was thick and curly,
but did not grow to any great length. On the
skull the hair was jet-black and was soaked in
oil, so that it had the appearance or being
perfectly straight.</p>

<p>Ample trousers, the usual long shirt and Afghan
boots (which are not unlike European military
boots), made up the attire of the masculine
members of the community.</p>

<p>The women had, on a smaller scale, very
similar features to those of the men, and at a
distance their oval faces appeared quite handsome,
but on a closer inspection the lineaments
were much too elongated to be attractive. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-259" id="Pg_2-259"></a>[<a href="./images/2-259.png">259</a>]</span>
had a somewhat pulled appearance. Both men and
women were tall, slender and of very wiry build.</p>

<p>After sunset the women, with their heads
wrapped up in a sort of white chudder, thrown
gracefully behind the shoulders and reaching
down to the feet, began to prowl about in a
great state of excitement, carrying big balls of
flour paste and small wicker work plates, like
shields, covered over by a cloth. They lighted
a big fire in one of the small domed ovens, and
after beating the paste on the wicker shields till
it had spread into a thin layer, they quickly took
it up with their hands and, kneeling over the
blazing furnace, stuck the paste against the roof
of the oven. They used long leather gloves for
the purpose. While being baked the bread was
constantly sprinkled with water from a bowl
close at hand.</p>

<p>Nearly each house has its own outer oven, but
the one I was near seemed to be used by several
families, judging by a string of clamouring
women who impatiently&mdash;and did they not let the
others know how impatiently!&mdash;waited with
all necessaries in hand to bake bread for their
men. The respective husbands and sons squatted
around on their heels, languidly smoking their
pipes and urging their women to be quick. A
deal of good-natured chaff seemed to take place
during this daily operation, but the women
were quite in earnest and took themselves and
the process very seriously. They seemed much
concerned if one piece got too much burnt or
another not enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-260" id="Pg_2-260"></a>[<a href="./images/2-260.png">260</a>]</span></p>

<p>To the east by south-east of Warmal, about a
mile and a half off, were four semi-spherical
sand mounts standing prominent against the sky-line,
and a great number of sand hills of confused
formation. The several sand-banks which I had
observed in the morning on our march to this
place extended to a great length towards the
east, and were a great protection to Warmal
against the periodic northerly winds of the
summer. Hence the lack here of the familiar
wind-catchers and wind-protectors, found further
north, the sight of which one missed on the
roof tops after having become accustomed to
Sher-i-Nasrya and adjoining villages where no
roof was without one. Here there were only
one or two wind-catchers visible on the roofs
of the few two-storeyed houses of the richer
folks.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of dwellings in Warmal
was that over each front door there was a neat
little fowl-house, subdivided into a number of
square compartments. The place was simply
swarming with chickens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warmal</span> (altitude 2,100 feet) was left at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
on the 12th. We skirted extensive sand accumulations,
high to the north, lower towards the
south. The under portion of these deposits had
become semi-petrified up to a height varying from
20 feet to 50 feet in proportion to the loftiness
of the hills themselves. We were travelling in
a south-east direction along these sand banks cut
abruptly vertically, and when we left them and
turned due south across a flat bay in the desert
there were sand-hills to the east and west about
one mile apart.</p>

<p>At the most northern end of the western
range a round tower could be seen on the
summit of a hillock. Having crossed over the
low hill range before us we descended into
a long, flat, sandy stretch with tamarisk shrubs
in abundance. In an arc of a circle from north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-262" id="Pg_2-262"></a>[<a href="./images/2-262.png">262</a>]</span>
to south there extended sand accumulations in
various guises, the highest being some lofty
conical hills due east of our course. To the
west in the distance we were encircled by the
Patang Kuh and the Mukh Surk ranges, which
also extended from north to south.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-061.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-061_th.jpg" alt="The Gate of Rustam's City, as seen from Rustam's House." title="The Gate of Rustam's City, as seen from Rustam's House." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"> <span class="smcap">The Gate of Rustam's City</span>, as seen from Rustam's House.</p>

<p>Two farsakhs (eight miles) brought us to the
British Consular Postal Station of Mahommed
Raza Chah, a mud structure of two rooms and
an ante-room between. One room was full of
provisions, the other accommodated the three
postal <i>sawars</i> (riders). Twelve holes had been
dug in search of water, but only two had been
successful. One of the sawars, a Beluch, on a
<i>jumbaz</i> camel, was just coming in with the
post, and he was a very picturesque figure in his
white flowing robes and turban over the curly
long hair hanging upon his shoulders. One
mile off, six or seven more deep holes had been
bored for water, but with no success. Tamarisk
was plentiful.</p>

<p>We were now getting near the ruins of
Sher-i-Rustam or Sher-i-Sukhta, the city of
Rustam, the Persian hero. North-east of it
one came first to a ruined tower, then to a burial
ground with single graves and graves in sets of
two and three, very similar in shape to those we
had seen on the Kuh-i-Kwajah. These, too,
were above ground, but were made of mud
instead of stone. Most of the graves had been
broken through. The graveyard was situated
on a sand hillock.</p>

<p>In the distance, to the east and south-east of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-263" id="Pg_2-263"></a>[<a href="./images/2-263.png">263</a>]</span>
Rustam's city, there spread from the north a
long stretch of ruins, which probably were part
of the continuation of the great Zaidan. A
number of towers&mdash;as many as six being counted
in a line&mdash;and a high wall could be perceived
still standing. This must evidently have been a
fort, and had what appeared to be the wall of a
tower at its north-west end. Other extensive
ruins could just be observed further south-east,
and also to the south-west, where a high tower
stood prominent against the sky.</p>

<p>When close to Rustam's city we went through
a walled oblique-angled parallelogram enclosing
a tower. A great portion of the wall had
collapsed, but it appeared to have been an
outpost north of the city.</p>

<p>The next thing was an ancient dry canal
which came from the east by south-east, and we
then found ourselves before Rustam's abode.
The photograph given in the illustration was
taken as we approached the city and gives a
good idea of the place as it appeared beyond the
foreground of sand and salt. The place was in
most wonderful preservation considering its age.
There were four high towers to the north, the
two central towers which protected the city gate
being close together and more massive than the
corner ones, which were circular and tapering
towards the summit. The wall of the city was
castellated and stood some 30 feet high. The
city gate, protected by an outer screen, was to
the east, and was two-storeyed. It led directly
into the main street of the city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-264" id="Pg_2-264"></a>[<a href="./images/2-264.png">264</a>]</span></p>

<p>I cannot do better than enumerate the characteristics
of the city in the order in which I
noticed them on my visit to it. A path, like a
narrow platform, was visible all round half-way
up inside the wall, as well as another on the top
which gave access from one tower to another.
There were no steps to reach the summit of the
towers, but merely inclined planes.</p>

<p>On entering the city gate&mdash;the only one&mdash;one
came at once upon Rustam's palace&mdash;a three-tiered
domed structure with a great many lower
annexes on its western and southern sides. A
wall adjoining the city gate enclosed Rustam's
quarters, and had a large entrance cut into it
leading to the dwelling. The various floors
were reached by a series of tunnelled passages on
inclined planes. Rustam's favourite room was
said to have been the top one, represented in the
photograph facing page <a href="#Pg_2-266">266</a>, where the outside of
the two top storeys of the building can be seen.</p>

<p>The domed room was well preserved, and had
a sort of raised portion to sit upon. The ceiling
was nicely ornamented with a frieze and a design
of inverted angles. The room had four windows,
and a number of slits in the north wall for
ventilating purposes. It was a regular look-out
house, commanding a fine view all round above
the city wall of the great expanse of desert with
its ancient cities to the east, and distant blue
mountains to the west. There were a number
of receptacles, some of which had been used for
burning lights, and five doors leading into other
rooms. These rooms, however, were not so well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-265" id="Pg_2-265"></a>[<a href="./images/2-265.png">265</a>]</span>
preserved&mdash;in fact, they had mostly collapsed,
their side walls alone remaining. No wood had
been used in the construction of the building
and all the ceilings were vaulted.</p>

<p>Rustam's "compound," to use the handy
word of the east, occupied about one-quarter of
the area of the town and filled the entire south-east
corner. Besides the higher building it
contained a great many side structures, with
domes, unfortunately, only half-standing, and
showing the same peculiarity as all the other
domes in the city, <i>i.e.</i>, they had all collapsed on
the north side while the southern part was
preserved. In the photograph facing page <a href="#Pg_2-268">268</a> this
is shown very clearly. This was, of course, due
to the potent northerly winds. Rustam's tall
house and high walled enclosures can be seen in
this photograph, some semi-collapsed domes of
great proportions showing just above the high
enclosing wall.</p>

<p>A spacious court commanded by a raised
passage from north to south&mdash;evidently for
soldiers to patrol upon&mdash;was within the enclosure,
and, in fact, Rustam's premises formed a regular
strong citadel within the city.</p>

<p>On the ground floor, now considerably below
the level of the street outside, was a long room,
like a store-room. In the north wall it had
a most wonderful arrangement of ventilating
chambers, which made the room deliciously cool.
These contrivances were like slits in the wall,
with boxed-in channels, where a great draught
was set up by the natural inflow and outflow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-266" id="Pg_2-266"></a>[<a href="./images/2-266.png">266</a>]</span>
cooler and hotter air from above and under
ground, and from in and out of the sun. A
great many receptacles could be noticed in the
lower portion of the wall, and also some low
mangers, as if sheep had been kept here to
supply meat for the inmates of the citadel in
time of siege.</p>

<p>Next to this, with an entrance on the main
street, was Rustam's reception hall&mdash;a great big
room with domes no less than
18 feet high inside, but now
fallen through in two places.
There were doors on the south
and north, and eleven receptacles
specially constructed for lamps.
These receptacles were rather
quaint in their simple design.</p>

<p class="illc">receptacle for light.</p>

<p>All round Rustam's palace the
city wall was double, and strengthened
with outside battlements.
The same thing was noticeable in
two portions of the city wall to the west and south
sides. The city wall was irregular in shape, and
impressed one as having been built at various
epochs, and the city had the appearance of having
been enlarged in comparatively recent times.
There was a moat outside the wall, but in many
places it had got filled up with sand. A glance
at the plan which I drew of the city will give
an idea of its shape.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-063.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-063_th.jpg" alt="The Remains of the Two Upper Storeys of Rustam's House." title="The Remains of the Two Upper Storeys of Rustam's House." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Remains of the Two Upper Storeys of Rustam's House.</p>

<p>On the north side of the main street, opposite
Rustam's house, was a large stable, unroofed, and
showing in the wall a number of mangers, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-267" id="Pg_2-267"></a>[<a href="./images/2-267.png">267</a>]</span>
appeared as if a large number of horses had been
kept.</p>

<p>Besides these there were in the western portion
of the city quantities of domed roofs, very
small, a few still perfect, but mostly fallen in on
the northern side. The houses directly under the
shelter of the northern wall were in the best
preservation, and many of them were still almost
entirely above ground. They were quadrangular
or rectangular in shape, made of mud, and with
a low door on the south side. The larger ones
had ventilating channels with perforated slits in
the north wall, like those in Rustam's store-room,
but all the houses were extremely small&mdash;an
average of 12 feet by 12 feet.</p>

<p>In the southern portion of the city, where
exposed to the wind, the dwellings were deep-buried
in sand, and hardly more than the domes
remained above ground. There were, however,
one or two higher buildings, presumably some
of the better dwellings inhabited by Rustam's
officers. A portion of the south walls, which,
curiously enough, had quadrangular towers instead
of tapering circular ones, had collapsed, and
so had the corresponding portion of the north wall.</p>

<p>The city wall was of great interest, and even
on the west side, where it was of less strength,
was constructed in successive tiers, each of less
than a man's height, and each with a path extending
all along so that it could be remanned
continuously in time of attack. When one man
of the higher platform fell another could replace
him immediately from the platform directly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-268" id="Pg_2-268"></a>[<a href="./images/2-268.png">268</a>]</span>
below. The towers were much higher than the
wall.</p>

<p>The city gate was of great strength the two
front towers being strengthened inwardly by a
third quadrangular tower. A raised block under
the gateway was said to be the execution place.</p>

<p>This city, historians declare, was destroyed by
Bahram, who caused it to be burnt, but there is
no evidence whatever in the buildings to show
that a conflagration ever occurred in this place
at all. In fact, it is rather difficult to understand
how buildings entirely of mud could be burned.
The city, it is said, was abandoned only about a
century ago, when the Sarbandi entered it by
treachery and drove out the Rais tribe.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-064.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-064_th.jpg" alt="Rustam's City, showing Rustam's House in Citadel, also domed roofs blown in from the North." title="Rustam's City, showing Rustam's House in Citadel, also domed roofs blown in from the North." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"> <span class="smcap">Rustam's City</span>, showing Rustam's House in Citadel, also domed roofs blown in from the North.</p>

<p>A few hundred feet to the south outside
the city wall are the remains of the stable of
Rustam's legendary gigantic horse. Part of the
high wall still stands up on the top of the
section of a vault, but the greater portion of
the building, which was evidently of great proportions,
is now buried in sand. The exact
spot is pointed out where the manger stood, and
so is the point where the heel ropes of this
famous horse were tied. This circumstance misled
one traveller into stating in 1872 that "two
hills, one mile apart to the south-west, denoted
the places where the manger and the spot where
the head of this famous horse were tied."
This error has been copied faithfully by subsequent
travellers, including very recent ones (see
<i>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</i>, February,
1902, page 142).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-269" id="Pg_2-269"></a>[<a href="./images/2-269.png">269</a>]</span></p>

<p>There seemed little doubt that the huge
building, of which the wall reproduced in the
illustration made part, was a stable, and that it
must have been of special importance could be
seen by the elaborate cross pattern decorations
on its outer face. The fragment of the wall
stands over 50 feet high, and to all appearance
some twenty more feet of it are underground,
buried by the sand. It had strong supports at
its base.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-065.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-065_th.jpg" alt="Untitled illustration." title="Untitled illustration." /></a></p>

<p>The stable was most peculiarly shaped, ending
in a sharp point at one end.</p>

<p>Another dry canal was noticeable to the
west of the ruins which went from south to
north, with a branch canal going due west.
North-west and west were to be seen other
ruined cities, one of which, with two high
quadrangular towers, was approximately three
miles distant. To the west on two hills were
fortresses, but between these and Rustam's city
lay an immense graveyard (about one mile
from Sher-i-Rustam), with graves above ground&mdash;mainly
single ones, but also a few family ones
in adjoining compartments.</p>

<p>As we went along due west another ruined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-270" id="Pg_2-270"></a>[<a href="./images/2-270.png">270</a>]</span>
city was pointed out, Zorap, a very ancient
place, where Bahram is said to have impaled the
body of Firamurz, Rustam's son.</p>

<p>We crossed two more dry canals of some
magnitude, running parallel, which showed that
in former days this now barren part of Sistan
must have been under flourishing cultivation.
In fact, further on we came upon traces of
houses and of extensive irrigation, the soil having
quite a different appearance to the usual <i>lut</i>
where left untouched by human tools.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-066.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-066_th.jpg" alt="Plan of Sher-i-Rustam." title="Plan of Sher-i-Rustam." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Plan of Sher-i-Rustam.</p>

<p>We then came across what at first seemed a
confused commotion of sand and mud, but its
formation was very curious, and looked as if it
covered an underlying city of great size. The
surface sand seemed to reproduce to a certain
extent the form of the structures that were
down below, such as quadrangular buildings,
walls, domes, etc. It was not the natural formation
of sand on a natural ground. In one
particular place a whole city wall with towers
could be traced, just showing above ground, so
perfectly rectangular that although covered by
sand it would seem certain that a fortress must
be buried under this spot.</p>

<p>All around these particular suspected buried
cities the sand is absolutely flat, and there would
be no other plausible reason for this most extraordinary
irregular accumulation of sand reproducing
forms of walls, domes and towers against
all the general rules of local sand accumulations,
unless such obstacles existed below to compel
the sand to accumulate in resemblance to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-271" id="Pg_2-271"></a>[<a href="./images/2-271.png">271</a>]</span>
This theory is strengthened too by the fact that,
here and there, some of the higher buildings
actually may be seen to project above ground.
The sand mixed with salt had, on getting wet,
become solid mud, baked hard by the sun.</p>

<p>Anybody interested in sand and its movements,
its ways and process of accumulation,
could not do better than take a trip to this part
of Sistan. Little as one may care about sand,
one is bound to get interested in its ways, and
one point in its favour is that with a certain
amount of logic and observation one can always
understand why it has assumed a certain formation
rather than another&mdash;a pleasing feature not
always existing in all geological formations of
the scenery one goes through.</p>

<p>The great expanse of irregular surface soil,
with its innumerable obstacles and undulations,
was, of course, bound to give curious results in
the sand accumulations south of it, where the
sand could deposit itself in a more undisturbed
fashion and was affected by purely natural
causes. Of course, sand hills do not accumulate
in the flat desert unless some obstacle&mdash;a mere
pebble, a tamarisk shrub, a ridge, or a stone, is
the primary cause of the accumulation. In the
present case, I think the greater number of
sand hills had been caused by tamarisk shrubs
arresting the sand along its flight southwards.</p>

<p>To enumerate and analyse each sand hill&mdash;there
were thousands and thousands&mdash;would
take volumes. I will limit myself to the
various most characteristic types of which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-272" id="Pg_2-272"></a>[<a href="./images/2-272.png">272</a>]</span>
give diagrams. The absolutely conical type
was here less noticeable, being too much exposed
to the wind, which gradually corroded one side of
each hill more than the other.</p>

<p>Whatever their shape, the highest point of
the sand hills was in any case always to the
north-east, the lower to the south-west. As can
be seen by the diagram there were single hills
and composite ones; there were well-rounded
hills, semi-spherical hills, and then came the sand
dunes, such as those on the right of our track,
like long parallel walls of sand extending for
great distances from east to west.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-067.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-067_th.jpg" alt="View of Sher-i-Rustam from Rustam's House. (West portion of City under the lee of wall.)" title="View of Sher-i-Rustam from Rustam's House. (West portion of City under the lee of wall.)" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">View of Sher-i-Rustam from Rustam's House.</span> (West portion of City under the lee of wall.)</p>

<p>One sand hill, 80 feet high, quite semi-spherical,
and with a solitary tamarisk tree on its
top, rising some 40 feet above all the others, was
quite a landmark along this route. It marked a
point from which to the east of our track we
found more uniformity in the shape of the sand
mounds, which were lower and all semi-spherical.
To the west of the track, curiously enough, there
were hardly any sand hills at all,&mdash;but this was
due, I think, to the fact that tamarisk shrubs
did not seem to flourish on the latter side, and
therefore did not cause the sand to accumulate.</p>

<p>Several miles further, however, at a spot
protected by high sand dunes, tamarisk trees were
found growing, some being 4 to 6 feet high, and
seeming quite luxuriant after the usual desert
shrubs which hardly ever rise above two to three
feet.</p>

<p>Sadek had purchased at Warmal two big
bottles of milk for my use, but as we had found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-273" id="Pg_2-273"></a>[<a href="./images/2-273.png">273</a>]</span>
no good water on the way and the heat of the
sun was great, he could not resist the temptation,
and had drunk it all. When I claimed it he
professed that my cats had stolen it. A long
jolting ride on the jumbaz camel produced the
marvellous result that, although the cats had
drunk the milk, Sadek himself was attacked by
indigestion caused by it. He seemed to suffer
internal agony, and lay on his camel's hump
doubled up with pain. He felt so very ill that
he requested me to take him on my camel, and
to let him exchange places with my driver. To
my sorrow I consented.</p>

<p>In a moment of temporary relief from the
aching of his digestive organs he entered into
one of his favourite geographical discussions.
Having for the twentieth time eradicated from
his brain the notion that London and Russia
were not suburbs of Bombay, he now wanted to
know whether <i>Yanki-dunia</i> (by which glorified
name the Persians call the United States of
America) were inside the "walls" of London
city or outside!</p>

<p>He had an idea that the earth was flat, and
that London, Bombay and Russia were together
on the extreme edge of it. The stars he believed
to be lighted up nightly, as one would candles or
paraffin lamps. Fortunately, while explaining to
me his extraordinary theory of how it was
that the moon never appeared alike on two
successive nights, he was again seized with
another fearful attack, and tumbled off the
camel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-274" id="Pg_2-274"></a>[<a href="./images/2-274.png">274</a>]</span></p>

<p>Sadek was most unfortunate with animals.
He was hated by them all. When he went
near horses they would kick, buck and neigh as
if a wolf had been at hand; mules stampeded at
his sight; cats bolted as if he were about to
beat them; and camels were restless and made
most fearful noises of disapproval and distress at
his approach. When he tried to get on and off,
the kneeling camel would suddenly spring up
again, causing him to fall, and when he did get
on the saddle the vicious brutes would assume a
most unusual and uncomfortable jerky motion,
which bumped him to such an extent that he
could not stand it long, and had to get off. The
animals evidently did it purposely to get rid of
him, for when I got on any of them they went
beautifully. Hence, whenever Sadek wished to
ride comfortably he always requested to change
seats with my driver, who occupied the front
seat on the hump of my camel.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">View of Sher-i-Rustam from Rustam's House.</span> (South-east section of City.)</p>

<p>We had a glorious sunset on that evening, not
unlike an aurora borealis, in brilliant rays of light
radiating from a central point. The sun had
already disappeared behind the blue mountain
chain, and each bright vermilion ray had like a
fish bone or like a peacock's feather, myriads of
cross off-shoots in the shape of lighter sprays of
light. There was a brilliant yellow glow which
tinted the blue sky and made it appear of various
gradations, from bright yellow at the lower
portion to various delicate shades of green in the
centre, blending again into a pure deep cobalt
blue high up in the sky, and on this glorious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-275" id="Pg_2-275"></a>[<a href="./images/2-275.png">275</a>]</span>
background the feathery vermilion sprays shot
up to half way across the celestial vault. Other
smaller sprays of vivid yellow light flared up in a
crescent nearer the mountain edge.</p>

<p>It was quite a glorious sight, unimpeded by
the grand spread of sand in the foreground and a
patch or two of humble tamarisks.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which night descends upon
the desert, is, as we noticed several times, quite
amazing. There was hardly any twilight at all.
In a few seconds this beautiful spectacle vanished
as by enchantment, and was converted into a
most mournful sight. The vermilion feathery
sprays, now deprived of the sun's light upon them,
were converted into so many gigantic black
feathers&mdash;of rather funereal appearance&mdash;and the
emerald green sky became of a dead leaden white.
The deep blue, fringed with red and yellow, of
the radiant mountains had now turned into a
sombre, blackish-grey.</p>

<p>About four miles before reaching Girdi a track
branches off, which avoids that place altogether,
and rejoins the track again one mile south of
Girdi, thus saving a considerable detour.</p>

<p>Our march that day had been from Warmal to
Mahommed Raza-Chah (altitude 2,100 feet),
eight miles, and from that place to Girdi-chah,
twenty-eight miles. The track between the two
latter stations was perfectly level, and on <i>jumbaz</i>
camels going at a good pace the journey had
occupied eight hours and a half.</p>

<p>On arriving at Girdi (altitude 2,200 feet), the
Beluch <i>sawar</i> whom I had taken as guide from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-276" id="Pg_2-276"></a>[<a href="./images/2-276.png">276</a>]</span>
Mahommed Raza Chah, and my Beluch driver
had a most touching scene on meeting some
Beluch of a caravan travelling in the opposite
direction to mine and camping at Girdi for the
night.</p>

<p>The men hastily dismounted from their camels,
put their heads together and pressed each the
other's right hand, holding it on the heart.</p>

<p>"It is my brother!" cried my camel man,
and then followed another outburst of effusion
on the brother's part, who seized my hand in
both his and shook it heartily for a considerable
time. The others followed suit.</p>

<p>There is nothing that an Afghan or a Beluch
likes better than a good hearty hand-shake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girdi-chah</span> (altitude 2,200 feet), a desolate spot
in a desolate region, remains impressed in the
minds of visitors merely and only for the vileness
of its water. Sadek brought me a glass of it for
inspection, and it was so thick with salt and dirt
that it resembled in colour and density a mixture
of milk and coffee. In flavour I do not know
what it was like because I would not drink it,
but I induced Sadek to try it and let me know,
and he said that it tasted like salt, sand, and bad
eggs mixed together. Unluckily, Sadek had
omitted to fill the skins with good water at
Warmal, and after our long march of 36 miles
we should have been in a bad plight, had not the
Beluch men in charge of the other caravan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-278" id="Pg_2-278"></a>[<a href="./images/2-278.png">278</a>]</span>
offered us some good water from their supply to
drink and cook with.</p>

<p>The post station at Girdi has a high wall
round it, with two rooms for <i>sawars</i>, and one
adjoining for their families, and grain shop.
There are four watch towers at the corners of
the wall of sun-dried bricks, and a path on the
top to go from one tower to the other. A
canal has been cut to drain as much rain water
(the only water obtainable here) as possible into
a small pond, but the pond was nearly dry and
only had in it some filthy salt water densely
mixed with camel refuse. It was of a ghastly
green with patches of brown, and some spots of
putrefaction in circular crowns of a whitish
colour. The surface was coated with a deposit
of sand, dirt and salt.</p>

<p>A few yards from the British Consular post-house
stood a small hut in which two Persian
Customs soldiers were stationed. They were
picturesquely attired in peaked white turbans,
long yellow coats, leather belts with powder and
bullet pouches, and various other adjuncts. They
were armed with long, old-fashioned matchlocks.</p>

<p>These men and the postal <i>sawars</i> complained
of the terrible water&mdash;and no wonder!&mdash;but
although they seemed painfully worn and thin it
had not actually caused them any special illness
so far. They generally laid in a small supply of
better water from the well six miles off.</p>

<p>On our way in that direction when we left the
next morning we again saw in the distance to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-279" id="Pg_2-279"></a>[<a href="./images/2-279.png">279</a>]</span>
east and south-east four or five ruined cities.
Tamarisk was plentiful and grew to quite a good
height.</p>

<p>We passed the post-house of Nawar-chah with
its well of fairly good water. The well was
some three feet in diameter and water had been
struck fifteen feet below the surface. The shelter,
with a low mud enclosure round it, was very
similar to the one at Mahommed Raza-chah.</p>

<p>At each post-house one was generally greeted
by a Beluch cat with pointed ears, who came
out in the hopes of getting a meal, then by
picturesque, bronzed-faced Beluch <i>sawars</i>, with
luxuriant black hair and beard, and white turbans
and cloaks. This being a minor station, there
were only two <i>sawars</i> and no animals, whereas at
stations like Girdi there were a <i>duffadar</i> in charge,
four <i>sawars</i>, two attendants, two camels and two
horses.</p>

<p>Some three miles south-east of Nawar more
ruins could be seen, a small tower and three
large square towers with north and south walls
in great part blown down, but with eastern and
western walls standing up to a great height. A
separate domed building could also be observed a
little way off.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting natural
sights on the journey to the Beluchistan frontier
was the great salt river&mdash;the Shela&mdash;which we
struck on that march, six miles from Nawar. It
was by far the largest river I had seen in Persia,
its channel being some 100 yards wide in places.
It came from the mountains to the south-west,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-280" id="Pg_2-280"></a>[<a href="./images/2-280.png">280</a>]</span>
where thick salt deposits are said to exist, and at
the point where we crossed it its course was
tortuous and the river made a sharp detour to
the south-east. All along the watercourse extensive
sediments of salt lined the edge of the
water, and higher up, near the mountains, the
water is said to be actually bridged over by salt
deposits several inches thick.</p>

<p>Most interesting incrustations of salt were
visible under the water, especially at the side of
the stream, where, with the reverberation of the
sun's rays, most beautiful effects of colour were
obtained in the salt crystals. The following
were the colours as they appeared from the
edges of the stream downwards:&mdash;light brown,
light green, emerald green, dark green, yellow,
warm yellow, deep yellow, then the deep green
of the limpid water.</p>

<p>The river banks on which we travelled were
about 60 feet high above the actual stream, and
owing to a huge diagonal crack across our track
we had to deviate nearly half a mile in order to
find a way where my camels could get across.
The Shela proceeds along a tortuous channel in a
south-easterly direction, enters Afghan territory,
and loses itself, as we shall see, in the south-west
Afghan desert.</p>

<p>It is said that when, which is now but rarely,
the Hamun-Halmund is inundated, the overflow
of water from the lake so formed finds its way
by a natural channel into the Shela, which it
swells, and the joint waters flow as far as and fill
the Shela Hamun or Zirreh in Afghanistan, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-281" id="Pg_2-281"></a>[<a href="./images/2-281.png">281</a>]</span>
is at a lower level than the Hamun-Halmund.
When I saw the lake in Afghanistan, however,
it was absolutely dry.</p>

<p>The Shela river had very large pools of deep
water almost all along that part of it which is in
Sistan territory, but there was hardly any water
flowing at all, so that nowadays in dry weather
it loses itself in the sand long before reaching
the depression in Afghan territory, where, by
the great salt deposits, it is evident that a lake
may have formerly existed, but not now.</p>

<p>After leaving the Shela we were travelling
again on the sandy <i>lut</i>, and not a blade of
vegetation of any kind could be seen. We came
to two tracks, one going south-west, the other
due south. We followed the latter. As we got
some miles further south a region of tamarisks
began, and they got bigger and bigger as we
went along. Where some shelter existed from
the north winds, the shrubs had developed into
quite big trees, some measuring as much as 20 feet
in height. For a desert, this seemed to us quite
a forest. Near the well of salt water, half way
(12 miles) between the two postal stations, the
tamarisks were quite thick.</p>

<p>Sixteen miles from Nawar, however, some
great sand dunes, like waves of a sea, extending
from east to west, were again found, together
with undulations of sand and gravel, and here
tamarisks again became scarce. The track had
been marked with cairns of stones at the sides.
Where the wind had full sway, the long sand
banks, parallel to one another and very regular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-282" id="Pg_2-282"></a>[<a href="./images/2-282.png">282</a>]</span>
in their formation, appeared exactly like the
waves of a stormy ocean.</p>

<p>The track went towards the south-west,
where one has to get round the point of
Afghanistan, which, projects west as far as
the Kuh-i-Malek-Siah (Mountains). We were
steering into what appeared at first a double row
of mountains in a mountain mass generally called
the Malek-Siah. To the west, however, on
getting nearer we could count as many as four
different ranges and two more to the east of us.
The last range, beyond all of the four western
ones, had in its S.S.W. some very high peaks
which I should roughly estimate at about eight
to ten thousand feet above the plain. Due
west there were also some high points rising
approximately from six to seven thousand feet,
and in front of these and nearest to the observer, a
low hill range. A high even-topped range, like a
whale's back, and not above 3,000 feet above the
plain, had a conical hill on the highest part
of its summit. The loftiest mountains were
observed from south to south-west, and they,
too, had a low hill barrier before them. Many
of the peaks were very sharply pointed, and
highest of all stood a strange looking three-humped
mountain (280&deg; W.) with a deep cut
on its westerly side, and a pointed peak standing
by it.</p>

<p>The sand under foot had given place here to
gravel and large pebbles, yellow, red, grey,
white and green, all well rounded as if they had
been rolled by water for many a mile. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-283" id="Pg_2-283"></a>[<a href="./images/2-283.png">283</a>]</span>
underlying sand was cut into many channels by
the action of water. We were some four miles
off the mountainous mass. Tamarisk was scarce
and undersized.</p>

<p>We were gradually rising on a slightly inclined
plain, and on examining the ground one could
not help thinking with what terrific force the
torrents must come down&mdash;when they do come
down&mdash;from the mountain sides which they
drain before losing themselves in the sand.
During abnormally rainy weather, no doubt, a
good deal of this drainage forms an actual stream
which goes to swell the river Shela. Its
channel comes from Hormak and flows first in a
north-easterly then in an almost due easterly
direction.</p>

<p>We had intended stopping at Hormak, thirty-two
miles from Girdi, our previous halting place,
and we had been on the saddle from 9 in the
morning till 8.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when we came across a lot
of Afghans with their camels, and they told us that
we were on the wrong track for the post-house
and well. It was very dark and we could not
see where we were going, as the sand had
covered up the track. We were among a lot of
confused sand hills, and the high mountains stood
directly in front like a formidable black barrier,
their contour line just distinguishable against the
sky.</p>

<p>The camel driver, who had made me discharge
the postal <i>sawar</i> guide, because he was
certain he knew the road well himself, was
now at a loss. The Afghans collected round us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-284" id="Pg_2-284"></a>[<a href="./images/2-284.png">284</a>]</span>
and yelled at the top of their voices that Hormak
was to the west of us, and the camel man
insisted that the post house must surely be on
the high track, on which we certainly seemed to
have got again.</p>

<p>I had ridden ahead, and after an anxious hour
Sadek, with all the luggage, and the second camel
man arrived, and we decided to leave the track and
try our luck among the mountains to the west.</p>

<p>Now, to find a little mud house, hidden in
some sheltered spot among rocks and hills, on
a dark night is not the easiest of matters. The
camels stumbled among the big boulders when
once we had got off the track, and we had to
dismount and walk. As luck would have it,
after going about half an hour we came to a
nice spring of water, of which in the stillness
of the night we could plainly hear the gurgling.
Guided by it, and a few feet above it in a
sheltered position, we struck the post-house.</p>

<p>The post-house has, of course, been built
here (one mile away from the high track)
because of this spring. There is a direct track
to it which branches off the main track, about
3 miles north, but we had missed this.</p>

<p>The night was a very cold one&mdash;we were at
3,380 feet above sea level&mdash;and we lighted a big
fire in the middle of the small mud room. As
there was no outlet for the smoke except the
door, in a few minutes the place got unbearably
hot, and I had to clear out, but Sadek and my
camel men, who were regular salamanders, seemed
to enjoy it and found it quite comfortable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-285" id="Pg_2-285"></a>[<a href="./images/2-285.png">285</a>]</span></p>

<p>There were two rooms, one occupied by the
four postal <i>sawars</i>, the other by five Persian
Customs employees. The two camels and two
horses for the postal service were kept in the mud
walled enclosure.</p>

<p>Hormak, when the sun rose, proved to be one
of the most picturesquely situated stations on the
entire route between Sher-i-Nasrya and Nushki.
It stood on a hill of sand and gravel in the centre
of a basin of high reddish-brown mountains
which screened it all round. There was an
opening to the east which gave a glimpse of the
desert extending into Afghanistan, this station
being not far from the border.</p>

<p>Our track was to the south-west, and wound
round between handsome mountains. A strange
high pyramid of rock stood on our way, and
the sides of the mountains, where cut by the
water, showed the interesting process of petrification
in its various stages in the strata of the
mountains. In hills of conical formation the
centre was the first to become solidified, and
where subsequent rain storms had washed away
the coating around that had not yet become
petrified curious rocky pillars were left standing
bare on the landscape.</p>

<p>We altered our course to due south along a river
bed, and had high sand hills to our right. Now
that we were approaching Beluchistan the track
was well defined, and about 16 feet broad, with
sides marked by a row of stones. To the west
of the track were a series of high sand walls
(facing west) 300 feet high, and some most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-286" id="Pg_2-286"></a>[<a href="./images/2-286.png">286</a>]</span>
peculiar red, pointed, conical hills rose above
them on the east side of these walls. It was
after reaching these peculiarly coloured hills
that the track began a gradual descent. The
highest point on the track was 3,670 feet.</p>

<p>We passed a strange mount shaped like a
mushroom, and the same formation could be
noticed on a smaller scale in many other smaller
hills, the lower portion of which had been
corroded by wind or water or both, until the
petrified centre of the hill remained like a stem
supporting a rounded cap of semi-petrified earth
above it.</p>

<p>From the west there descended another water
channel, quite dry. We next found ourselves in
a large basin one mile across and with an outlet
to the north-east, at which spot a square castle-shaped
mountain stared us in the face. A similar
fortress, also of natural formation, was to the
south-south-west, and between these two the
Robat track was traced. Another outlet existed
to the south-east. To the west, north, east and
south-east there were a great many sand-hills,
and to the south-south-west high rugged
mountains.</p>

<p>A strong south-westerly gale was blowing and
the sky was black and leaden with heavy clouds.
We were caught in several heavy showers as we
proceeded along a broad flat valley amid high and
much broken-up black mountains (north-west)
the innumerable sharp pointed peaks of which
resembled the teeth of a saw. At their foot
between them and our track stretched a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-287" id="Pg_2-287"></a>[<a href="./images/2-287.png">287</a>]</span>
screen of sand accumulations&mdash;in this case facing
north-west instead of west, the alteration in the
direction being undoubtedly due to the effect of
the mountains on the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>To the east there were rocks of a bright
cadmium yellow colour, some 45 feet high, with
deposits of sand and gravel on them as thick
again (45 feet). The mountains behind these
rocks showed a similar formation, the yellow
rock, however, rising to 120 feet with rock
above it of a blackish-violet colour, getting
greenish towards the top where more exposed to
the wind.</p>

<p>The valley along which we were travelling
averaged about 200 yards wide, from the sand
hills on one side to those on the other, and was
at an incline, the eastern portion being much
lower than the western. The yellow rocks at
the side bore marks of having been subjected to
the corrosive action of water, which must occasionally
fill this gully to a great height during
torrential rains.</p>

<p>We came to a most interesting point&mdash;the
Malek Siah Ziarat, which in theory marks the
point where the three coveted countries, <i>i.e.</i>,
Persia, Afghanistan and Beluchistan, meet. The
actual frontier, however, is on the summit of the
watershed, a short distance to the east of the
Ziarat.</p>

<p>This Ziarat was a fine one, of the Beluch
pattern, not covered over by a building such as
those, for instance, that we had found on Kuh-i-Kwajah.
There seemed to be a fate against pho<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-288" id="Pg_2-288"></a>[<a href="./images/2-288.png">288</a>]</span>tographing
these Ziarats. It was only under the
greatest disadvantages that I was ever able to
photograph them. On this particular occasion
I had hardly time to produce my camera before
a downpour, such as I had seldom experienced,
made it impossible to take a decent picture of it.</p>

<p>There was a central tomb 15 feet long, of big
round white stones, supported on upright pillars
of brown and green stone, and a white marble
pillar at each end. Circular white marble slabs
were resting on the tomb itself, and a few feet
from this tomb all round was a wall, 3 feet high,
of upright pillars, of brown and green stone,
forming an oblong that measured 20 feet by
8 feet, with a walled entrance at its south-eastern
extremity. An additional wall like a crescent
protected the south-eastern end of the oblong,
and due east in a line were three stone cairns
with bundles of upright sticks fixed into them,
on which hung rags of all colours.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-069.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-069_th.jpg" alt="Plan of Kuh-i-Malek Siah Ziarat." title="Plan of Kuh-i-Malek Siah Ziarat." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Plan of Kuh-i-Malek Siah Ziarat.</p>

<p>To the west of the tomb, between it and the
enclosing wall, was a great collection of long
sticks and tree branches&mdash;which must have been
brought here from a great distance&mdash;and at their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-289" id="Pg_2-289"></a>[<a href="./images/2-289.png">289</a>]</span>
foot offerings of all sorts, such as goat-horns,
ropes, leather bags, hair, stones, marble vessels,
and numberless pieces of cloth.</p>

<p>In the spring of each year, I am told, the
Beluch make a pilgrimage to this Ziarat, and
deposit some very quaint little dolls made with
much symbolic anatomical detail.</p>

<p>Extending west, in the direction of Mecca,
from the main Ziarat, were nine more stone
cairns, most of them having a <i>panache</i> of sticks
and being divided into sets of three each, with a
higher wall in the shape of crescents between.
A second wall of round stones protected the
north-west side of the Ziarat. Where it met the
entrance way into the inner wall there was a
much used sacrificial slab where sheep were
beheaded.</p>

<p>To the north-east of the Ziarat were a number
of cairns, and a small stone shelter in which lived
a hermit. This old fanatic came out to greet us
with unintelligible howls, carrying his vessel for
alms, and a long stick to which a rag was attached.
He touched us all on the head with it,
which was meant as a blessing, and we gave him
some silver pieces, which he said he did not
want for himself, but for the Ziarat. He wore
chains like a prisoner. He appeared to be in an
advanced stage of idiocy and <i>abrutissement</i>, caused
by his lonely life in his 5 feet cubic stone cabin
among the desolate Malek-Siah mountains.</p>

<p>Having at this place rounded the most westerly
point of the Afghan frontier we turned due east
on a tortuous but well defined track. At this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-290" id="Pg_2-290"></a>[<a href="./images/2-290.png">290</a>]</span>
point began the actual British road, and being
from this point under British supervision it was
well kept, and made extremely easy for camel
and horse traffic.</p>

<p>Three miles from the Ziarat the sand hills
began to get smaller and smaller to the west, but
still remained high to the east. One was particularly
struck by the peculiar formation of the
mountains. To the west they formed a continuous
rugged, irregularly topped chain, with
sharp pointed peaks, whereas to the east we had
isolated, single domed hills all well rounded and
smooth.</p>

<p>Where the track turns sharply south-east we
entered a vast basin with picturesque high mountains
to the south and north, and a series of single
well-rounded mounds in front of them, rising
from one to two thousand feet above the plain.</p>

<p>On nearing Robat one finds the scenery plainly
illustrating the entire evolution of a small sand
hill into a high mountain. We have the tiny
mounds of sand, only a few inches high,
clogged round tamarisk shrubs, then further
higher and higher mounds, until they spread out
so far that two, three, or more blend together,
forming a low bank, and then banks increase to
high dunes 40 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet high.
These grow higher and higher still; the sand
below is compressed by the weight above; water
exercises its petrifying influence from the base
upward, and from the centre outward, and more
sand accumulates on the upper surface until they
become actual hill ranges of a compact shale-like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-291" id="Pg_2-291"></a>[<a href="./images/2-291.png">291</a>]</span>
formation in horizontal strata, each stratum being
slightly less hardened than the underlying, and
each showing plainly defined the actions of water
and sun to which they were exposed when
uppermost. Then, above these hills, further
accumulations have formed, which solidifying in
turn have in the course of centuries become
high mountains. They have, however, never
lost the characteristics of the little primary
accumulation against the humble tamarisk, to
which they still bear, on a large scale, the closest
resemblance.</p>

<p>We passed a great many parallel sand dunes,
100 feet high, east and west of our track, and
went through a cut in one of these sand banks,
beyond which the sand hills had accumulated in
a somewhat confused fashion upon a crescent-shaped
area. They seemed of a more ancient
formation than those to the west of the track,
and had a great quantity of shingle upon them,
which gave them a black and greenish appearance,
while those to the west were of a light
brown colour. The shingle in this case, I think,
had not formed on the hillocks themselves, but
had been washed and blown down from the high
mountains to the east.</p>

<p>We were now in the territory of Beluchistan,
and with a bounding heart&mdash;after the experience
of Persian rest-houses&mdash;we saw a nice clean
square whitewashed bungalow standing on a high
prominence under the shelter of a rugged
mountain. This was Robat, the furthermost
British post in West Beluchistan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-292" id="Pg_2-292"></a>[<a href="./images/2-292.png">292</a>]</span></p>

<p>Although still some 463 miles from the nearest
railway I looked upon this spot as the end of my
difficult travelling, and, taking into consideration
the fact that most of that distance had to be
performed across barren and practically uninhabited
country, I found that I was not far
wrong in my opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">South-west</span> of Robat (at 210&deg; bearings magnetic)
stands a fine mountain, the Lahr Kuh, and from
it descends a little stream flowing towards the
north-east. There is a large <i>thana</i> (fortified post-house)
at Robat of eight rooms and a spacious
court for horses. A shop with grain and provisions
is found here, and a post office with the
familiar black board outside on which one was
rather amused to read the usual postal notices in
the English language stuck upon it&mdash;announcing
Queen Victoria's death, notifying that the office
would be closed on such and such bank holidays,
and other public news.</p>

<p>The quarters of the <i>Jemadar</i> and his seven
levies, of the <i>Duffadar</i> and the postmaster, were
enclosed in the high-walled <i>thana</i> with its imposing
entrance gate and four towers at the
corners. Beyond the <i>thana</i> was the old resting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-294" id="Pg_2-294"></a>[<a href="./images/2-294.png">294</a>]</span>
place built of stone, with six rooms, but now
rather in a tumbling-down condition.</p>

<p>Then last, but not least, of the buildings was
the new bungalow, with a nice portico all round.
It contained four spacious, lofty rooms with well-drawing
chimneys. There were windows, but
not yet with glass in them, and this was rather
an advantage, because the air of the mountains
was pure and better than would have been the
shut-in atmosphere of a room. Each room had
a bathroom attached to it&mdash;but of course the
bath had to be brought by the traveller himself.</p>

<p class="illc">Sa&iuml;d Khan, Duffadar and Levies at the Perso-Beluch Frontier Port of Robat.</p>

<p>This was one of two types of rest-houses which
are being built by the British Government for
travellers on the Nushki-Robat route. The
other kind was of similar architecture but with
only two rooms instead of four. These bungalows
were solidly built, well ventilated and excellent
in every way&mdash;of course in relation to
the country they were in. It was not proposed
when they were put up to compete in comfort
and <i>cuisine</i> with the Carlton Hotel in London,
that of Ritz in Paris, or the Waldorf-Astoria of
New York. They were mere rest-houses for
traders and travellers accustomed to that particular
kind of travelling, and the British Government
ought to be greatly thanked for building these
shelters at the principal halting-places on the
route. Only a few are completed yet between
Robat and Nushki, but their construction is
going ahead fast, and within the next year or so,
if I understood right, they would all be ready to
accommodate travellers. They were a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-295" id="Pg_2-295"></a>[<a href="./images/2-295.png">295</a>]</span>
improvement on the old <i>thanas</i>, which, although
comfortable enough, were not always quite so
clean on account of natives using them.</p>

<p>After travelling in Persia, where one climbs
down a good deal in one's ideas of luxury and
comfort and is glad to put up even in the most
modest hovels, it seemed to me quite the zenith
of luxury and comfort to set foot inside a real
whitewashed rest-house, with mats on the floor
and a fire blazing in a real chimney. News had
come that I should arrive that afternoon, and the
levies with the <i>Jemadar</i> in their best clothes all
turned out to receive me, which involved considerable
hand-shaking and elaborate compliments,
after which I was led into the room that had
been prepared for me.</p>

<p>Sa&iuml;d Khan, who has been employed by the
Government to look after the postal arrangements
and other political work on the Persian
side of the frontier, was also here parading with
the others, as can be seen in the illustration.</p>

<p>Sa&iuml;d Khan was a tall, intelligent, black-bearded,
fearless person, wearing a handsome black frock-coat,
a mass of gold embroidery on the chest, and
a beautiful silver-mounted sword&mdash;which, by the
way, he wore in a sensible fashion slung across
his shoulder; with his well-cut features, strong,
almost fierce mouth, finely chiselled nostrils and
eagle eyes he was quite a striking figure.</p>

<p>The <i>Duffadar</i>, who stood on his right hand,
had a most honest and good-natured face, and he,
too, looked very smart in his uniform, cartridge
bandolier, silver-handled sword and Enfield rifle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-296" id="Pg_2-296"></a>[<a href="./images/2-296.png">296</a>]</span>
His men were also armed with this rifle which,
although of old pattern, is very serviceable.</p>

<p>With the exception of Sa&iuml;d Khan, the people
represented in the illustration formed the entire
stationary male population of Robat, but some
small black tents could be seen in a gully a little
way off inhabited by nomad Beluch.</p>

<p>On hearing that I was much interested in
music, the <i>Duffadar</i>, who was a bit of a musician
himself, arranged a concert in which all the
local talent took part. On this and many other
later occasions I heard Beluch music and singing
and saw their dancing, and as I also heard a good
deal of Persian music while in Persia I daresay a
few words upon the music and dancing of the
two countries will not be out of place. In many
ways they are akin.</p>

<p>A large instrument called the <i>Dumbirah</i> or
<i>Dambura</i>&mdash;something like an Italian mandola&mdash;was
produced which was handsomely carved and
inlaid in silver. It had three strings, two of
which were played as bass; on the third the air
was twanged in double notes, as the thumb and
first finger are held together, the first finger
slightly forward, and an oscillation is given from
the wrist to the hand in order to sound the note
twice as it catches first in the thumb then in the
first finger. The effect obtained is similar to
that of the <i>Occalilli</i> of Honolulu, or not unlike a
mandoline, only with the Beluch instrument the
oscillations are slower.</p>

<p>The movement of the favourite Beluch melodies
resembles that of a Neapolitan tarantella, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-297" id="Pg_2-297"></a>[<a href="./images/2-297.png">297</a>]</span>
these airs are generally more lively than melodies
of most other Asiatic people. Endless variations
are made on the same air according to the
ability and temperament of the musician. The
notes of the two bass strings of the instrument
are never altered, but always give the same
accompaniment on being twanged together with
the violin string on which only the actual
melody is picked out.</p>

<p>There is then the <i>Soroz</i>, a kind of violin
made of a half pumpkin, which forms the
sounding board, and a handle to it with four
keys and four strings. It is played with a bow
of horsehair.</p>

<p>The other instruments in use are the <i>Seranghi</i>,
a kind of superior violin such as the two central
ones represented in the full page illustration.
It has no less than fourteen keys, is hollow and
uncovered in its upper portion, but has a skin
stretched in the lower half of its sounding case.
It is also perforated underneath and is played
with a bow called <i>gazer</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Rabab</i> is a larger wooden instrument of
a somewhat elongated shape, and its lower
portion is also covered by a tight sheepskin&mdash;the
remainder of the uncovered wood being
prettily inlaid with silver and bone. This
instrument is twanged with the fingers and has
eighteen <i>killi</i> or keys, twelve with metal strings
and six with gut strings.</p>

<p>The <i>Surna</i>, or flute, is made of bamboo with
a brass funnel. The mouthpiece is very ingenious,
made of crushed cane fastened into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-298" id="Pg_2-298"></a>[<a href="./images/2-298.png">298</a>]</span>
a cup which is firmly applied to the lips, thus
preventing any wind escaping at the sides. It
certainly gives a very piercing sound when
played loud.</p>

<p>The <i>Dohl</i>, or drum, was also of wood with
sheepskins drawn tight at the two ends while
wet, rolled up all round the rims of the apertures,
and kept in position by leather strips.</p>

<p class="illc">Beluch Musicians (at Sibi.)</p>

<p>Besides these the Beluch shows much ingenuity
in improvising musical instruments to
accompany his songs, out of any article which
will give some sound, such as his rifle rod,
which he balances on a bit of string and taps
upon with the blade of his knife, or two pieces
of wood which he uses as castanets, and, failing
all these, snapping his fingers and keeping time
with the melody.</p>

<p>There is a certain weird, barbaric charm in
Beluch melodies, and, unlike the Persian, the
Beluch possesses a very keen ear, in fact, a
thorough musical ear, even according to our
rules of harmony. To an unthoughtful European
there may indeed be a certain monotony
in Beluch melodies, but never a grating discord
which will set one's teeth on edge.</p>

<p>Monotony in music, or rather, a repetition
of the same melody until it becomes monotonous,
is, rather than otherwise&mdash;if one comes
to think of it&mdash;a fault on the right side, for if
a melody is repeated time after time it means
that the people themselves like it and appreciate
it. There is no doubt that anybody with an
unspoilt musical ear rather fancies listening over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-299" id="Pg_2-299"></a>[<a href="./images/2-299.png">299</a>]</span>
and over again to a melody which appeals to
him&mdash;and we need not go as far as Beluchistan
to be convinced of this&mdash;for we ourselves have
been known to take fancies to songs of so high
a standard as <i>Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay</i>, <i>The Honeysuckle
and the Bee</i>, &amp;c., and we hum them while
soaking in our morning tub, we whistle them as
we go down to breakfast, we strum them on the
piano after breakfast, we hear them rattled
outside by a barrel organ, as many times as there
are forthcoming pennies from windows, while
we are having lunch, we hear them pathetically
sung at afternoon parties by hired entertainers,
bands play them in the restaurants during dinner,
and we hear them in the theatres, in music halls,
and everywhere,&mdash;so that we cannot very well
blame others for the monotony of their melodies
since we largely follow the same course as
theirs.</p>

<p>The Beluch plays and sings because it gives
him real pleasure, and he is quite carried away
by his music. Certain notes and combinations
of notes, especially such as are very
high and shrill, but in good tune, seem to go
straight to his heart, and he revels in them.
When singing, therefore, he prefers to sing in
falsetto&mdash;as high as the furthest strain of his
voice permits&mdash;and having worked himself into a
semi-dazed state gradually descends to low deep
notes, which by contrast appeal to him and not
only give balance and character to his melody
but produce quite a good harmonious effect.
The low notes, however, are never ejaculated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-300" id="Pg_2-300"></a>[<a href="./images/2-300.png">300</a>]</span>
but hummed, almost buzzed, with a vibration in
the voice which is most melodious. The sound
is like an indefinite letter U.</p>

<p>The beginning of a song is somewhat sudden
and startling, and usually too loud, as if the
singer had not properly gauged the extent of his
voice in relation to the instrumental accompaniment,
but he soon manages to get in most perfect
unison with the melody of the dambura and the
violin or other instruments, except in cases of
singers endowed with extra musical genius, when
they will go on improvising by the hour, using
the theme as a guide. They generally sing in a
minor key, with pretty refrains at the end of
each bar.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-072.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-072_th.jpg" alt="Untitled illustration." title="Untitled illustration." /></a></p>

<p>The most common and favourite air is the
above on which elaborate variations are added.</p>

<p>The Beluch singer seldom changes from minor
into major or from one key into another, but he
is very fond of repeating the same melody in all
the octaves within the utmost limits of the
compass of his voice. It is considered a feat in
singing to hold a note for an interminable time,
as also to go through the greater portion of the
melody without taking breath, and it really
seemed extraordinary that some of the singers
did not break a blood vessel in the process. The
eyes of the performers got so swollen and almost
shooting out of the head with holding the notes so
long, and the veins of the temples and arteries in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-301" id="Pg_2-301"></a>[<a href="./images/2-301.png">301</a>]</span>
the neck swelled to such an extent as to cause
serious apprehension.</p>

<p>On one occasion I heard an improvised song
with the accompaniment of the <i>soroz</i> (violin)
only. This time&mdash;an exception in my experience&mdash;the
song was given in a deep, low,
nasal voice, each note being tremulous and held
on for several minutes in a most plaintive
manner.</p>

<p>Some of the love songs were quite pathetic and
touching, and in the war songs, the grievances
were poured forth very plaintively with an accompaniment
of strings and drums and burst out
suddenly into fire and anger. At this point,
when the musicians were carried away by the
martial words of the song, the instrumental
accompaniment became next to diabolical. It
was very inspiriting, no doubt, and made them
feel very war-like. The din was certainly such
as might have turned any man into a fighter.</p>

<p>Love songs, in which the singer imitated
women's voices to perfection, were really most
graceful and sad, and quite interesting were the
musical recitatives with violin accompaniments
which the Beluch render in quite a masterly
way.</p>

<p>Then there was the comic song&mdash;quick-timed
and full of life&mdash;much too full and too comic to
appeal to a European, and so fully illustrated that
personally, I infinitely preferred the more melancholic
ones which had more music in them.</p>

<p>Duets and trios were occasionally attempted
with quite good results, except that there always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-302" id="Pg_2-302"></a>[<a href="./images/2-302.png">302</a>]</span>
seemed to be a competition as to who should
start highest, and this had occasionally a grating
effect.</p>

<p>The Beluch possess most soft musical voices,
well-rounded and graceful, quite a contrast even
in mere conversation to those of their neighbours
the Persians or the Afghans; but the character
of the Beluch songs and music is not dissimilar
from the Persian, and both betray a markedly
Arab origin. In Persian songs, too, an <i>andante</i>
movement with chorus joining in every few
bars frequently occurs, but in the Persian
chorus we generally find a liking for chromatic
diminuendos and crescendos, which are not so
frequent in Beluch music.</p>

<p>Persian music is inspiriting. There are
certain musical notes the vibrations of which
seem to go to the heart more than others, and on
these notes the Persian musician will work his
melody. Sad love songs in a falsetto voice are
prevalent, and are sung so high that, as with
the Beluch, it makes one really quite anxious for
the safety of the singer. The notes are kept on so
long and the melody repeated so often, that the
artery and veins in the singer's neck and temples
bulge out in a most abnormal manner.</p>

<p>There is no actual end to a Persian melody,
which terminates with the exhaustion of the
singer, or abruptly by the sign of the hearers
who get tired of it. The musicians every now
and then join in the chorus and repeat the
refrain.</p>

<p>Tenor solo songs by boys are much ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-303" id="Pg_2-303"></a>[<a href="./images/2-303.png">303</a>]</span>preciated,
and these, too, are very plaintive with
frequent scales in them and certain notes held
long at the end of each bar where the chorus
join in. These sustained notes have modulations
in them with infinitesimal fractions of tones.
Ululations with long, nasal, interminable notes
and capricious variations at the fancy of the
singer, but based on some popular theme are
also much liked by Persians.</p>

<p>More than in anything else, however, the
Persian, like the Beluch, delights in tremulous
notes, of which he makes ample use in his
melodies.</p>

<p>The rhythm of Persian and Beluch music is
much alike, although as far as instrumental
execution goes the Persian surpasses the Beluch,
having a greater variety in his orchestra and
the instruments being more perfectly constructed.</p>

<p>The <i>Santurie</i>, for instance, a kind of zither,
with eighteen sets of three strings each, is a
most harmonious instrument from which beautiful
effects can be obtained by the player.</p>

<p>The <i>thar</i>> a sort of guitar, has four keys and
is played with a plectrum, and the <i>Kermanche</i>,
<i>Cynthour</i>, <i>Tchogor</i>, <i>the Tchaminioho</i>&mdash;the latter,
a circular instrument covered by a skin, with
one metal and two gut strings, on a long metal
stand, is played with a bow;&mdash;the <i>dumbuk</i>
(drum), with only one skin pasted round its
single aperture, the lower part being solid; the
flute pure and proper, with five apertures on one
side and one on the other, on which very low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-304" id="Pg_2-304"></a>[<a href="./images/2-304.png">304</a>]</span>
clear notes are obtained, and a pretty tremolo,&mdash;and
other instruments of minor importance, are
all employed in Persia.</p>

<p>The Persians are masters at playing the drum.
Most marvellous effects are obtained by them.
They hold the drum on the left leg with the left
arm resting on it, and tap it with the tips of
their fingers round its edge. For broader
notes it is struck with the palm of the hand.
Soft, gentle notes as well as the rumbling sound
in good time with the air they accompany, are
extracted from the instrument, so fast in its
vibrations as to produce a continuous sound that
one would never believe came from a drum.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-073.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-073_th.jpg" alt="Beluch Dance (at Sibi.)" title="Beluch Dance (at Sibi.)" /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Beluch Dance (at Sibi.)</p>

<p>Metallic castanets are used both by the
Persian and Beluch in the dancing, and it is
usually the dancers&mdash;one or more boys&mdash;who
play them.</p>

<p>Many of the songs and melodies I heard in
Persia reminded me very forcibly of Spanish
melodies, which, like these, are undoubtedly of
Arab origin.</p>

<p>Whatever fault one may find with Persian or
Beluch music, one cannot say that the performers
do not play with an immense deal of feeling and
<i>entrain</i>&mdash;a quality (the primary one, to my
mind,) in music often lacking in musicians
nearer home, but never in Orientals.</p>

<p>The dancing, both Persian and Beluch, is not
so interesting. It is usually executed by effeminate
long-haired boys generally dressed in a
long pleated coat with a tight belt, and wearing
a number of metal bells attached to the ankles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-305" id="Pg_2-305"></a>[<a href="./images/2-305.png">305</a>]</span>
The Persian is probably the more lascivious of
the two in his movements, and, having begun
by throwing his long shock of hair backwards
twirls round gracefully enough, keeping good
time with the music. This is merely a feat of
endurance, resembling the dancing or spinning
dervishes of Egypt, and generally ends by the
dancer suddenly squatting down upon the floor
with his flowing gown fully expanded in a circle
around him. The skill of the dancer is shown
most in successive dances, such as the slow
progression by merely twisting the feet to right
and left, occasionally varied by raising one foot
directly above the other, then throwing the
head far back and the body in a strained curve,
with arms raised fluttering like a flying bird,
while the song to which he dances imitates a
nightingale.</p>

<p>Contortions and suggestive waist movements
are much indulged in Persian dancing, as well
as throwing the body backwards with the hands
almost touching the ground behind and walking
while in this position&mdash;not unlike an exaggerated
form of the "cake-walk" of our American
cousins.</p>

<p>Each dance is closed by the dancer throwing
himself down upon his knees in front of the
musicians, or in turn before each of the
spectators.</p>

<p>Beluch dancing was very similar, although
much simpler. The two photographs, reproduced
in the illustrations, which I took at Sibi,
show one a row of Beluch musicians, the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-306" id="Pg_2-306"></a>[<a href="./images/2-306.png">306</a>]</span>
a Beluch boy in the act of dancing a sort of
toe-and-heel dance, in which with extended arms
he gradually fluttered round, keeping time with
the music. In some of the quicker movements
he either snapped his fingers or used wooden
castanets, or held the pleated skirt of his coat
fully extended like butterfly wings. There was
very little variation to his dancing which, like
the Persian was more a feat of endurance and
speed than a graceful performance. The ankle
did most of the work.</p>

<p class="illc">The Beluch-Afghan Boundary Cairn and Malek-Siah Mountains in Background.</p>

<p>Somewhat more wild and primitive was
the <i>chap</i> which I witnessed at a camp in north-west
Beluchistan. It consisted in swinging the
body from right to left, lifting up now one leg and
then the other, and waving the head to and fro
in a most violent manner. The Beluch get much
excited over this dance, which requires some
degree of stubborn tenacity, and the spectators
urge the dancer to continue when he shows
signs of getting tired. All superfluous clothing
is discarded in a most alarming manner at various
stages of this performance, and the arms are
flapped vigorously against the naked body which
is made to sound like a drum. The performance
is not allowed to stop until the dancer is quite
exhausted, when he simply collapses in the arms
of one of his friends. The musical accompaniment
to this dance verges on the diabolical, the
rhythm of what melody there is being interspersed
with abundant howls, yells and snapping
of fingers from the enthusiastic crowd
all round.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Robat (altitude 3,480 feet) we took the
capital road which followed a dry river bed until
we got quite away from the hills. When the
track turned south-east a beautiful view of the
Afghan desert south of the Halmund, was
obtained to the north-east, while south-south-east
(180&deg;, bearings magnetic) stood a high peak, the
Saindak Mount. We first skirted very rugged
mountains to the south-west which were brilliant
in colour and had many peaks fluted by water
erosion. Sand-hills gradually dwindled away,
leaving long, flat-topped sand-banks invariably
facing north. To the south was quite a high
sand mountain.</p>

<p>A quaint rock resembling a huge camel's head
could be seen to our left above a hill. Then,
six miles from Robat, sand-hills began again.
The track here lay only a few yards from the
Afghan boundary which was marked by stone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-308" id="Pg_2-308"></a>[<a href="./images/2-308.png">308</a>]</span>
cairns, six feet high, painted white. To the
south was a rugged chain of mountains with
low sand-hills before it, and to the north across
the Afghan border could now be plainly seen
the interesting salt deposit of God-i-Zirreh,
and another whose name I do not know. I
crossed into Afghan territory with the object of
visiting them, and a description will be found in
the next chapter.</p>

<p>I returned into Beluchistan to the spot, 14
miles from Robat, where a small salt rivulet
swelled by tributaries, descends from the mountains
to the south and west. When in flood this
stream, which must be enormously enlarged,
carries down a great quantity of tamarisk wood,
much of which could be seen deposited a long
distance from the water's normal banks.</p>

<p>The road stretched in front of us in a perfectly
straight line, with neat stone borders on either side,
and one got so tired of seeing that line in front of
one's nose that one welcomed the smallest change&mdash;even
a slight ascent or a curve&mdash;in its endless,
monotonous straightness. We came by and by
to a little ascent&mdash;quite steep enough for camels.
We could have easily avoided it by leaving the
road and making a detour at the foot of the hill
close to the Afghan boundary. Some caravans
do.</p>

<p>From the highest point of the road as we
looked back to the north-north-west we saw
behind us sand hills, that showed traces of
being still much at the mercy of the wind.
Further behind, still north-north-west, was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-309" id="Pg_2-309"></a>[<a href="./images/2-309.png">309</a>]</span>
high pointed peak, and then a long blue chain
extending from south-west to north-east just
rising out of the sand mist. The highest peaks
were at the most extreme north-east point.
Then the mountains became lower and lower,
and the horizon met the flat long line of the
desert.</p>

<p>A fine view of the Afghan desert, with its two
extensive salt deposits, can be obtained from
Laskerisha, a name given to a brackish well on
the hill side (3,590 feet) with a ditch and hollow
next to it for the convenience of camels. A
triangular unroofed shelter has been erected some
80 feet below the well on the hill slope, and
other wells have been bored close by, the water
of which is undrinkable. This was the highest
point of the road 3,590 feet, on that march.
Before reaching it we saw a castle-like structure
surmounting a peak of the mountain that we
had been following to the south; there appeared
to be actual windows in it, showing the light
through, and a track leading up to it. Unfortunately,
the sun&mdash;quite blinding&mdash;was just behind
it when I passed it, and I could not well
ascertain with my telescope whether it was a
natural formation of rock or a real ancient
fortress, nor could I get any information on the
subject from the natives, and it was too far out
of my track for me to go and visit it.</p>

<p>On our descent on the south-east side of the
hill we came across semi-spherical sand mounds
in great numbers; the mountains on our right
were apparently of volcanic formation. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-310" id="Pg_2-310"></a>[<a href="./images/2-310.png">310</a>]</span>
were very highly coloured, generally bright red
with green summits; then there were mountains
deep red all over, and further on stood one green
from top to bottom, although there was not a
thread of vegetation upon it. At the foot of the
mountains on the edge of the desert were a few
dried up tamarisks.</p>

<p>We stopped at Mahommed Raza-chah, where
there are five wells, three of good water and two
brackish ones. There was a mere mud <i>thana</i> at
this place, but wood and bricks were being
brought up to construct a bungalow.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-075.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-075_th.jpg" alt="Rest House at Mahommed Raza Chah overlooking Afghan Desert." title="Rest House at Mahommed Raza Chah overlooking Afghan Desert." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Rest House at Mahommed Raza Chah overlooking Afghan Desert.</p>

<p>A number of Beluch were encamped here in
their little black tents, hardly five feet high, and
with one side of the tent raised up on two sticks.
The interior of the tents seemed to be a mass of
rags and dirt, among which some primitive
implements, such as a wooden pestle and mortar,
for pounding wheat, and a bowl or two, could be
detected. Otherwise they were most miserable.
The tents seemed mostly in the possession of
women, children and decrepit old men, the
younger folks seeking a livelier life further afield.
It is often in the most humble places, however,
that one finds unexpected charms.</p>

<p>On the alarm being given that an intruding
stranger was at hand the women hastily shut up
all the tents, and a picturesque old fellow stalked
me about, seeming to become extremely anxious
when I was photographing, a proceeding which
he did not quite understand. A young man on
a camel was coming towards us singing, and
inside one of the tents I heard a great commotion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-311" id="Pg_2-311"></a>[<a href="./images/2-311.png">311</a>]</span>
evidently caused by the approaching voice. An
old woman, in fact, peeped out from a fissure
and gave a powerful squeak. She leapt out
excitedly, nearly tearing down the whole tent
in the process, and, crying bitter tears, rushed
with extended arms towards the camel man.</p>

<p>The young fellow having hastily dismounted,
a most touching scene of motherly affection
ensued, for, as the old man explained to me, he
was her son. The poor shrivelled creature threw
her arms around his neck and kissed him fondly,
first on one cheek and then upon the other, after
which, having affectionately taken his face
between her hands, she impressed another long,
long kiss in the middle of his forehead. She
caressed him to her heart's content, the boy
looking quite pathetically graceful and reverent
under the circumstances. A similar treatment
was meted out to him by his sisters, and they all
shed tears of delight at seeing one another.
Family affection, as well as affection among
tribesmen, is indeed extraordinarily effusive and
genuine among Beluch of all classes.</p>

<p>The women I saw at this camp wore a sort
of long shirt with a sash, and had broad bead
and shell bracelets round their wrists.</p>

<p>Mahommed Raza-chah was 3,820 feet above
sea level, and the track from this point went
south east (to 110&deg; bearings magnetic). There
was a <i>duffadar</i> in charge of two stations with
four <i>sawars</i> and four camels. It was all one
could do upon this road to find anything of
some interest, barring the geological formation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-312" id="Pg_2-312"></a>[<a href="./images/2-312.png">312</a>]</span>
of the country and the movement of the sand,
which rather began to pall upon one after
months of nothing else, and when one came
across a patch of tamarisk trees a little taller
than usual one could not take one's eyes off
them, they seemed such interesting objects in
the monotonous marches.</p>

<p>Twelve miles from Mahommed Raza, tamarisks
seemed to flourish, for water was to be
found some twenty feet below the surface. A
well had been bored for the use of caravans, and
the water was quite good. The track was somewhat
undulating in this portion of the journey,
rising, however, to no greater elevation than
100 feet, but quite steep enough for camels.</p>

<p>About eleven miles from Mahommed Raza-chah,
a track diverged to Mirjawa. One
noticed on the mountains to our right (south-west)
a superabundance of tamarisk, the cause
of this abnormal vegetation being undoubtedly
long streaks of moisture filtering through the
sand. No actual water, however, was visible
flowing, not even along a deep channel which
bore the marks of having been cut by it, and
in which salt deposits were to be seen on the
surface soil.</p>

<p>Kirtaka, the next rest-house, was by no means
an attractive place, but was interesting, inasmuch
as, besides the track over the mountains leading
to Mirjawa, a direct route went from this point
to Sher-i-Nasrya in Sistan, which city could be
reached in three days, by crossing Afghan territory,
and cutting off the long westerly detour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-313" id="Pg_2-313"></a>[<a href="./images/2-313.png">313</a>]</span>
via Robat&mdash;the Malek-Siah; and yet another
track to Cabul, the capital of Afghanistan,
which could be reached in twenty days. The
latter track was said to be absolutely waterless
for the first three days' march, no wells and
therefore no villages being found, but after
three days, on striking the Halmund, plenty
of water, fuel, and food could be obtained, and
plenty of people were to be met with.</p>

<p>South-east of the old towered enclosure, which
had five rooms, a new bungalow of two rooms
and bathrooms, with kitchen buildings apart
behind, was being built. It was sheltered by
a rugged background of mountains of no great
height, but picturesque enough and highly
coloured when the sun shone upon them. Being,
however, well rounded and looking like petrified
accumulations of sand, they did not quite compare
in interest with the fantastic cutting edges
of the Malek-Siah and neighbouring ranges.
They formed the southern barrier to the Beluchistan
extension of the Afghan desert.</p>

<p>The altitude of Kirtaka was 3,710 feet.</p>

<p>There was a curious Beluch grave here made
of white stones with an edge of grey pebbles,
and a circle round it, with a smaller outer kneeling
place, such as may be seen in the numerous
Mesjids so common all over the country, the
various styles of which will be duly described in
a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>Innumerable sand hills and, in fact, a long hill
range some 350 feet high stood to the west in
front of the rocky mountains behind. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-314" id="Pg_2-314"></a>[<a href="./images/2-314.png">314</a>]</span>
caused a great many ups and downs on the
track, the principal heights I measured being:
3,800 feet, 3,700 feet, 3,420 feet (8 miles from
Kirtaka), this latter altitude where the road lay
close to the mountains. Beyond this point the
track was south-east (125&deg; bearings magnetic)
with picturesque mountains on the east-south-east
and high red sand hills in the east, one isolated
high black hill lying in the desert beyond. A
very pointed conical hill was noticeable, and
another like a small replica of Fujisan of Japan
fame. This latter hill was in Afghan territory.
A number of great rocky pillars stood upright
above the hill tops. Twelve miles from Kirtaka
we crossed a river bed 150 feet wide, which lost
itself in the Afghan desert. Then a mile further
we came to another river bed.</p>

<p class="illc">Rock Pillar between Kirtaka and Saindak.</p>

<p>The track here (about 13 miles from
Kirtaka) turned south-west following the river
bed, then due south, where among the mountains
we saw a huge pillar of a brilliant yellow
colour and over 50 feet high, standing up by the
roadside. The illustration gives a fair idea of it.
To the south-east in the direction of our track,
which for a change was quite tortuous, were
mounds of sand and debris. The red rock of
the mountains seemed crumbling towards the
east, whereas the hills to the west were well
rounded and padded with sand and gravel.</p>

<p>We went over a low pass 3,810 feet, and then
along a flat basin with hills to the south-east, and
outlets both to the south-east and east. We had
descended to 3,680 feet, but had to go up another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-315" id="Pg_2-315"></a>[<a href="./images/2-315.png">315</a>]</span>
pass 4,060 feet, the highest we had so far encountered.
Innumerable yellow sand hills were
before us to the north-north-east, and here we
were on a sort of flat sandy plateau, three-quarters
of a mile wide and a mile and a half long. Ten
sharp-pointed peaks could be counted to the
south-south-east, high mountains were before us
to the south-east, and a long range beyond them
east-south-east. Sand dunes, shaped like the back
of a whale were to the east, and a remarkable
spherical mount south-south-east directly in front
of the ten peaks. We arrived at Saindak.</p>

hills&mdash;Curious formation of hill range&mdash;Barchans
and how they are formed&mdash;Alexander's march
through the country&mdash;The water of Godar-i-Chah&mdash;Afghans
and their looks.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> excursion which I made into Afghan
territory to the salt deposit of Gaud- or God-i-Zirreh,
and a lower depression to the east of it,
was of great interest to me.</p>

<p>There are a great many theories regarding
these former salt lakes, and it is not easy to say
which is right and which is wrong. The
general belief is that these lakes were formed by
the overflow of the Halmund swamp into the
Shela (river) which carried sufficient water not
only to fill up the God-i-Zirreh, but to overflow
when this was full into the next depression east
of the Zirreh.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that to a great extent this
was the case, but these lakes were, I think, also
fed more directly by several small streams
descending from the mountains to the south and
west of the Zirreh, which form the watershed&mdash;and
very probably also from the north by the
Halmund River itself. Both lakes were dry and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-317" id="Pg_2-317"></a>[<a href="./images/2-317.png">317</a>]</span>
seemed to have been so for some time. The
God-i-Zirreh, forming now a great expanse of
solid salt some 26 miles long by 5 or 6 wide,
extends in a long oval from west to east. The
other lake was somewhat smaller.</p>

<p>To the south of these salt deposits in the
zones between them and the present Afghan
boundary, and forming the southern fringe of
the Afghan desert, the soil is covered with
gravel and stones washed down from the mountain
sides. Very stony indeed is the desert
towards the Malek-Siah end, then further north-east
appear brown earth, shale, and sand. To
the north of the lakes was a long line of bright
yellow sand extending from west to east and
broad enough towards the north to reach the
bank of the river Halmund. Another shiny
patch, which at first, from a distance, I had
mistaken for another smaller lake, turned out on
examination to be a stretch of polished shale
which shone in the sun, and appeared like bluish
water.</p>

<p>Stunted tamarisk grows in some parts but not
in the immediate neighbourhood of the salt
deposits. We have here instead a belt of
myriads of small conical sand-hills, also spreading
from west to east, quite low to the west and
getting higher for several miles towards the east.
In the south-west part of the desert, curiously
enough, between the zone of conical hills and
the salt deposits, and parallel to both, lies a row
of semi-spherical sand and salt mounds of a
whitish colour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-318" id="Pg_2-318"></a>[<a href="./images/2-318.png">318</a>]</span></p>

<p>To the east-south-east of the lakes the sand-hills
rise to a great height and eventually form a
high ridge, which for some reason or other is
cut perpendicularly on its western side, possibly
as the result of a volcanic commotion. Of
similar origin probably was the gigantic crack
caused by an earthquake which we shall examine
later on near Nushki. In fact, both the crack
at Nushki and the collapse of the west side of
this hill range, as well as a great portion of that
deep crack in the earth's crest in which the
Shela flows, have very likely been formed by the
same cause. They are within the same zone of
volcanic formation. In the particular case of
this hill range in Afghanistan the collapse did
not appear to me to be due to the action of
water, but to a sudden crumbling which had
caused a very sharp vertical cut.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-078.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-078_th.jpg" alt="Sand Hills." title="Sand Hills." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Sand Hills.</p>

<p>To the north of the salt wastes was another
long belt of yellow sand extending for some
40 miles, upon which there was absolutely no
vegetation, while intervening between the salt
and this sand flat were numerous sand barchans,
like horseshoes, with a gradual slope on the
windward side (north) and a crescent hollow
with a steep but not quite vertical bank on the
lee side.</p>

<p>I noticed all over Persia, and in Beluchistan as
well as here, that these sand barchans, or barchanes,
will only form on level ground&mdash;generally on
extensive plains. All single sand hills, however,
whether barchans, conical, semi-spherical, or of
more irregular shapes, are invariably caused by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-319" id="Pg_2-319"></a>[<a href="./images/2-319.png">319</a>]</span>
primary obstacle, however small, arresting the
sand. Various are the theories with regard to
the formation of these barchans, and especially
with regard to the formation of the hollow on
the lee side.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-079.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-079_th.jpg" alt="Untitled illustration." title="Untitled illustration." /></a></p>

<p>The explanation from my own observation has&mdash;if
no other&mdash;at least the merit of simplicity.
The wind, on meeting the semi-circular back of
the barchan, is diverted on the two sides of it;
these two currents come into violent collision
again on the lee-side, where, the air being more
or less still, a considerable portion of the wind is
forcibly driven back towards the barchan, corroding
its side in a double rotatory way, each
such circle having for a diameter the radius of
the barchan crescent containing them. In fact
in many barchans the sand ripples on the windward
slopes cross the direction of the wind at
right angles. A line of sand formed in the centre
of the barchan crescent in the opposite direction
to the wind is often to be seen during wind
storms or soon after. I have also seen barchans,
the inner crescent of which showed beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-320" id="Pg_2-320"></a>[<a href="./images/2-320.png">320</a>]</span>
doubt that when there is a prevalent wind from
one side only, the above explanation, although
less scientifically obscure and elaborate than most,
applies, and, I think, it may eventually be found
quite the most probable.</p>

<p>The diagram here given will illustrate and, I
hope, make quite clear the meaning of my words.
In the centre of the crescent can be noticed the
action of the parting wind currents.</p>

<p class="illc">A Caravan of Donkeys in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>North of Kirtaka was a very pointed high
conical hill, and not far from it a small replica of
Fujisan in Japan, so much were the lines like
those of the Japanese mountain. A great many of
the drain channels from the mountains to the
south extended very far into the desert and some
as far as the God-i-Zirreh.</p>

<p>It is also very probable that in the days when
Sistan was a most populous region, with uninterrupted
towns and villages along and near the
Halmund, numerous canals may have intersected
the Zirreh region and rendered it a very fertile
plain. History would indeed point forcibly
towards such a hypothesis. Ample proof that
the plain was inhabited still remains in the ruins
of Godar-i-Chah, situated at the western limit of
the Zirreh salt deposits, Chah-i-Mardan, where a
ruined fort and a Ziarat are said to exist, Gumbaz-i-Chah,
and others. All these places are now
deserted and are being fast buried by the sand.
They are mostly along the Shela (river) banks,
and the natives of Sistan say that they have heard
from their ancestors that when the Shela did flow
freely its water was quite drinkable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-321" id="Pg_2-321"></a>[<a href="./images/2-321.png">321</a>]</span></p>

<p>There was a well at Godar-i-Chah&mdash;hence its
name, "the well of Godar"&mdash;almost entirely
dried up and of water so foul that it was not
possible to drink it, and another just as bad was
said to exist at Gumbaz.</p>

<p>It would be most interesting if one could get
at the actual history of this part of the world and
gain an insight into its former prosperity and
civilisation. It is quite probable that Alexander,
in his progress through Beluchistan and Sistan,
must have come through this country. No army&mdash;not
even with a new Craterus at its head&mdash;could,
of course, march elephants, camels and
horses through that country to-day, and this has
led some critics to doubt that Alexander could
have done so, or to believe that, if he did so, he
must have been deceived by his guides who tried
to bring him as far as possible from water. But
those critics forget that in Alexander's days this
portion of country was extremely civilised, fertile,
and supplied with plenty of water&mdash;or else how
can we account for the innumerable ruins we
find there, and for the many canals for irrigation?</p>

<p>Sir Charles McGregor, Goldsmid, Bellew,
Major MacMahon, Napier, and one or two
others who have visited the country north of the
Zirreh, can fully testify to the amazing remains
of former prosperity in Sistan and south-west
Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Sir Charles McGregor gives an amusing
receipt for those who wish to know what the
water at Godar-i-Chah is like without having the
trouble of going there. "Take the first nasty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-322" id="Pg_2-322"></a>[<a href="./images/2-322.png">322</a>]</span>looking
water you can find. Mix salt with it
until it tastes as nasty as it looks, then impregnate
it with gas from a London street lamp,
and add a little bilge-water, shake vigorously and
it is ready for use." Major McMahon also
testifies to the accuracy of the above receipt, but,
he adds, "it was not nearly so bad as much we
found elsewhere."</p>

<p>The Zirreh seemed just like a great stretch of
country under snow, the thick salt sediment was
so beautifully white. It formed a deep depression
in the centre. The second deposits to
the east of the Zirreh were of a similar shape,
with salt extremely thick, but not quite so
extensive as in the Zirreh. Near the edge of
both dry lakes there was absolutely no vegetation,
but most beautifully coloured stones could be
found, such as red and brown jasper and agatescent
quartz, chalcedony, white and brown
limestone.</p>

<p>As I was returning towards the Beluchistan
boundary among the sand hills I came upon
about a dozen Afghans, who looked as suspiciously
at me as I did at them. At first I
thought they were soldiers, and as I did not
much care to be caught by them and have my
goods confiscated&mdash;no Englishmen being allowed
in their territory&mdash;I requested them to stop some
way off and explain what they wanted, while I was
snapshotting them. They had a great big white
fluffy dog with them who seemed very anxious
to have a go at the Sahib. One man was asked
to come forward alone, which he did with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-323" id="Pg_2-323"></a>[<a href="./images/2-323.png">323</a>]</span>
turban right over his eyes, while the others
formed a line behind and appeared most puzzled
as to what was going to happen. He said they
were glad to see me in their country and that
they were "good people," and would not injure
nor trouble me in any way; so I gave them a small
present, which seemed to please them much, and
they became quite friendly. They seemed to
have some coarse humour about them and were
rather boisterous. Their faces, however, did not
quite appeal to me.</p>

<p>The Afghan invariably has a slippery,
treacherous look about his countenance which he
cannot disguise, and which, personally, I do not
much admire. He seldom looks at one straight
in the face, can be very sullen when he is not
boisterous, and I should think would easily seek
cause of offence and pick a quarrel with any one
weaker than himself in order to have a fight.
These fellows were, for instance, most unlike the
gentlemanly Beluch. They shouted at the top
of their voices when they spoke, and were
uncouth in speech and manner. I was rather
glad when they departed.</p>

<p>Further on I came upon more people and
animals, but they, too, were quite peaceful.</p>

<p>Having accomplished my object I again crossed
over into Beluchistan.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The Thana and New Bungalow at Saindak.</span> (Saindak Mt. in background.)</p>

<p>On my arrival they proceeded to clear one of
the chambers for me, and to my astonishment
out of it came four wretched men chained
together by the hands and feet and in a pitiable
condition. Not that their countenances, when
one examined their faces, called for much pity.
More palpably criminal types could be found
nowhere, but somehow or other to see these
poor devils stumbling along, with the iron rings
round their bruised and sore ankles showing
through the torn rags which covered their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-325" id="Pg_2-325"></a>[<a href="./images/2-325.png">325</a>]</span>
skeleton legs, and the agonized expressions on
their worn, repulsively cruel faces, was not an
edifying sight. They had been brought down
here to work and, for prisoners, were treated
considerately enough, I suppose. But they
seemed very ill and suffering. Two were
robbers, the other two&mdash;father and son&mdash;had
murdered a man and stolen 400 sheep. They
were condemned to captivity for life.</p>

<p>I declined to put up in that room, especially
when I happened to peep in and was nearly
choked by the foul odour that emanated from
inside, and preferred&mdash;although it was very cold&mdash;to
inhabit the unroofed new two-roomed
bungalow in course of construction, which I
found really very comfortable.</p>

<p>As can be seen by the photograph the thana
and bungalow of Saindak are built on rather
an attractive site under the shelter of the Saindak
Mountain. Whenever I see a mountain I cannot
resist the temptation to go up it, and now,
after all the thousands of miles of flat country
I had traversed, I felt this desire more strongly
than ever. The ascent of the mountain presented
no difficulty except that its rocky sides
were somewhat steep. I resolved to go up
early the next morning before making a start
with my camels.</p>

<p>In the meantime during the evening I was
instructed by Mahommed Hussein, my camel
man, in the Beluch fashion of making bread&mdash;really
a most ingenious device. A stone of
moderate size, say 4 inches in diameter and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-326" id="Pg_2-326"></a>[<a href="./images/2-326.png">326</a>]</span>
round as can be found, is made red hot on the
fire, and upon it a coating of paste&mdash;flour, water,
and salt&mdash;is deposited evenly so as to make an
envelope of paste one inch thick all over.
Three, four, five, or as many of these balls as
required being made, they are placed in a circle
near a blazing fire, so that the outside may get
baked as well as the inside. When ready for
consumption the balls are split open and the
stones removed. The bread is really most
excellent and resembles a biscuit.</p>

<p class="illc">Beluch Prisoners at Saindak.</p>

<p>At Saindak (altitude 3,810 feet) there are a
number of wells, mostly very salt, but one has
quite fair water, only slightly brackish. The
water, however, had a peculiar taste of its own,
as if it had gone through lead deposits, and, on
mentioning this to some Beluch they told me
that lead was, in fact, found on the mountains
just above this camp. Having drunk two
glasses of this water I was taken with bad
internal pains, but I must in fairness own that
I do not know whether to attribute this entirely
to the water or to indiscreet consumption of an
irresistible, extra rich plum-cake which the
wonderful Sadek now produced, much to my
surprise and delight, from among my provisions.</p>

<p>Travellers, however, would do well to bring
their own supply of water from Kirtaka, if they
are coming from Robat, or from Mukak, if
travelling from Quetta.</p>

<p>The ascent to the summit of the Saindak
mountain well repays the traveller for the
exertion of getting there, and that not only on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-327" id="Pg_2-327"></a>[<a href="./images/2-327.png">327</a>]</span>
account of its geological formation. Looking
over the lower mountains one obtained a magnificent
view of the Afghan desert as far as the
eye could see, to the north-west and north-east,
while to the west lay a mountain mass, the
Mirjawa mountains, and innumerable sand hills.
To the south-south-west towered above everything
the double-humped active volcano of
Kuh-i-Daftan, with its snow-capped crater. It
was smoking, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'nothwithstanding'">notwithstanding</ins> the ridiculous
theory entertained by some F.R.G.S. that volcanoes
cannot exist so far south in the Northern
Hemisphere! We saw this volcano for several
days and it threw up considerable volumes of
smoke. At night it occasionally had quite a
glow above its crater.</p>

<p>The volcano, I need not say, is in Persian
territory, and is some 60 miles distant, as the crow
flies, from Saindak, although in the clear atmosphere
it does not appear more than a few miles
off. It is a most impressive mountain.</p>

<p>Parallel ridges of sand hills, facing east, were
to be seen to the south-west of the Saindak
mountain, and then a wide flat plain, beyond
which four successive mountain ranges, formed a
powerful barrier. To the south-east also were
high mountains.</p>

<p>On the top of the mountain we came upon
some of the holes that contain lead and <i>Surmah</i>
or <i>Surf</i>&mdash;a substance much used by women in
Persia, Afghanistan, Beluchistan and India for
blackening the lashes and lower eyelids. Surmah
was plentiful enough, especially between two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-328" id="Pg_2-328"></a>[<a href="./images/2-328.png">328</a>]</span>
layers of perpendicular rock, and also in surface
pebbles when split open. Calcareous rock with
galena was to be found, besides fragments of
calcite, gypsum, and slag.</p>

<p>It appeared that the natives must at some time
have tried to exploit these mines in a primitive
manner, for there were many holes bored all over
the top of the mountain, and near them bits of
coal embedded in slag. These excavations were
generally bored in mounds of yellow earth, or,
rather, the mounds were of that colour because
of the earth which had been extracted from the
borings, the colour of the surrounding earth and
rock being grey and black. Lead filaments in
brittle layers were also noticeable mixed with the
earth. Two inches below the ground one found,
on digging, a thick deposit of salt and gypsum.</p>

<p>My camels with loads had made an early start,
and on my returning to camp some three hours
after their departure I proceeded to catch them
up on my excellent <i>mari</i>. There was very little
of interest on the march. We rose over a gentle
incline, travelling due south upon undulating
ground to an altitude of 3,870 feet, beyond
which we descended into a flat basin with a
broad outlet to the south-south-east, and another
south-west by a narrow defile in the mountain
range. We then crossed a broader plain, about
two miles broad, with good grazing for camels,
and here again, being well out in the open, we
got a magnificent view of the Daftan volcano
(south-west) in all its splendour.</p>

<p>We reached Mukak (3,580 feet) in the after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-329" id="Pg_2-329"></a>[<a href="./images/2-329.png">329</a>]</span>noon,
the distance from Saindak being 13 miles,
880 yards, and, owing to my camels being tired,
and the small beady plant called <i>regheth</i>&mdash;much
cherished by camels&mdash;plentiful, we halted for the
remainder of the day.</p>

<p>At this place we found the usual <i>jemadar</i>, a
<i>duffadar</i>, and four men, and were cordially
received by the <i>palawan's</i> moonshee, a nice fellow
who wore a peaked turban of gigantic size, and
a brown coat beautifully embroidered on the
back and sleeves with violet-coloured silk. The
embroidery, he informed me, took six years to
make&mdash;it was not fully completed yet&mdash;and, on
inquiring the cost of it, he said that it would
certainly fetch as much as 10 rupees (13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>)
when quite finished! The pattern on it was
most cleverly designed and produced a graceful
effect. On the middle of the sleeves were a
number of superposed T's made of ribbon bands
and with delicate ornamentations round them,
such as little squares with radiating threads, a
frieze going all round the arm, and parallel lines.
On the back was a large triangle upside down,
the base at the neck and the point downwards,
joining at its lower end a square the inside of
which was most elaborately embroidered.</p>

<p>The <i>palawan</i>, or strong man, in charge of this
station, was a man with a romantic history of
his own, and perhaps the British Government
were very wise to employ him. He is said to
possess enormous muscular strength, being able
to perform such amazing feats as reducing to
dust between his first finger and thumb a silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-330" id="Pg_2-330"></a>[<a href="./images/2-330.png">330</a>]</span>
rupee by merely rubbing it once, or breaking
any coin in two in his hands with the same ease
that one would a biscuit. A&iuml;d Mahommed,
that was his name, was unfortunately absent on
the day I passed through, so I was not able to
witness his marvellous feats&mdash;of strength or
palming(?)&mdash;and the accounts of his native admirers
were not to be taken <i>au pied de la lettre</i>.</p>

<p>Mukak had six mud rooms, three roofed over
and the others unroofed. Water was plentiful
but slightly brackish, and a salt rivulet, a few
inches broad, irrigated a patch or two of cultivation
below the rest house.</p>

<p>Among low hills, we rode away first due east
from Mukak, the track at a mile's distance rising
to 3,620 feet, and we remained at this altitude
for five miles. Again on this march we obtained
a glorious view (at 200&deg; b.m.) of the Daftan
volcano, with its two imposing white domes on
the crater sides. We had then gone north-east
for 6&frac12; miles, when, after rounding some sand
hills, our track proceeded again due east.</p>

<p>We had crossed a plain one mile broad and
four and a half miles long, where there was good
grazing (<i>regheth</i>) for camels, but no tamarisk.
At the termination of the plateau, which rose
some 50 feet higher than the remainder of it,
we commenced to descend by a gentle incline,
having high hills to our left (north) and low hills
to our right (south), the track being due east.
To the north-east we had another long, straight,
monotonous spread of fine sand and gravel in
slight undulations, and to the south-west very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-331" id="Pg_2-331"></a>[<a href="./images/2-331.png">331</a>]</span>
low ranges of sand hills varying in height from
20 feet to 100 feet. Before us on our left to 100
bearings magnetic (E.E.S.E.) stood above the
plain a pillar-shaped mound of enormous height
resembling, from a distance, a semi-ruined tower,
and south-south-east (150&deg; b.m.) another isolated
red mountain with a sharp, needle-like point.
Other smaller rocks, of sugar-loaf form, were
scattered about on our left.</p>

<p>By the roadside an enormous boulder weighing
several tons could be seen, the presence of which
could not easily be accounted for unless it had
been shot out by volcanic action. It was most
unlike the formation of the rock in the immediate
neighbourhood of it, and had all the
appearance of having dropped at this place.</p>

<p>The track again changed its course and
now went to east-south-east, (120&deg; b.m.). My
riding camel was taken very ill, and even
Mahommed's most affectionate language, and
the caresses he bestowed on him as if the animal
had been his dearest relation, had no appreciable
effect upon his health. The animal evidently
had a colic, caused, no doubt, by excessive
eating of <i>regheth</i> the previous day. He seemed
to have the greatest trouble in dragging his legs
along, and every now and then he languidly
swung his head round and gave me a <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'repoachful'">reproachful</ins>
look, which undoubtedly meant "Can't you see
I am ill? I wish you would get off."</p>

<p>Well, I did get off, although walking in the
desert is not a pleasure at any time, and when
we arrived at the next well, after a dreadfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-332" id="Pg_2-332"></a>[<a href="./images/2-332.png">332</a>]</span>
slow march, we proceeded to doctor up our
long-necked patient.</p>

<p>Now, doctoring a camel is not an easy matter,
for one cannot work on his imagination as
doctors do on human beings. When a camel is
ill, he is really ill. There was no mistake about
the symptoms of his complaint, and after a
consultation Sadek, Mahommed and I agreed
that a strong solution of salt and water should be
administered, which was easier said than done.
While the poor brute lay with his long neck
stretched upon the sand, moaning, groaning
and breathing heavily, we mixed a bag of salt&mdash;all
we had&mdash;with half a bucket of water, and
after endless trouble&mdash;for our patient was most
recalcitrant&mdash;poured the contents down his
throat.</p>

<p>We had some moments of great anxiety, for
the animal was taken with a fit. He fell on his
side, his legs quivered three or four times, and
for one moment we really thought our remedy
had killed him. The medicine, however, had
the desired effect, and about an hour later the
camel was again as lively as a cricket, and we
were able to continue.</p>

<p>The reader may perhaps gauge what the loss
of a camel would have been when he is told that
between Sher-i-Nasrya, Sistan, and Nushki&mdash;a
journey of some 500 miles&mdash;neither camels nor
any other mode of conveyance are, under
ordinary circumstances, to be procured.</p>

<p>We passed a conical hill, by the roadside,
which had thick deposits of gypsum on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-333" id="Pg_2-333"></a>[<a href="./images/2-333.png">333</a>]</span>
south-east side of its base, while on the north-west
side the process of petrification of the
sand was fully illustrated. The thin surface
layer when moist gets baked by the sun, and
thus begins its process of solidification; then
another layer of sand is deposited on it by the
wind and undergoes the same process, forming
the thin, horizontal strata so common in the
section of all these hills. The lower strata get
gradually harder and harder, but those nearer the
surface can be easily crumbled into sand again
by pressure between one's fingers.</p>

<p>These were the main altitudes registered on
the day's march: Plain, 3,220 feet; 16 miles
from Mukak, 3,200 feet; while a mile and a
half further we had gone as low as 2,500 feet on
a wide plain with undulations. The rocky
mountain, when seen edgewise from a distance,
had appeared like a tower; now, on approaching
it on its broad side, its silhouette altered its
semblance into that of an elongated crouching
lion.</p>

<p>Great quantities of gypsum could be seen in
layers under the sand and fragments that covered
the surface. In places the ground was quite
white as if with snow. The track, until we had
passed the isolated "lion" mountain (about 20
miles from Mukak), maintained a direction of east,
east-south-east, and south-east, but about a mile
further, it turned sharply northwards in a bed of
soft sand, between sand mounds to the north-east
and a sand bank facing north, the top of which,
full of humps, was not unlike a crocodile's back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-334" id="Pg_2-334"></a>[<a href="./images/2-334.png">334</a>]</span></p>

<p>To the right we had an open space where one
got a view of the desert and mountains to the
south, and then we wended our way, in zig-zag,
among sand hills bearing no unusual characteristics,
and travelled across a very sandy plain
with clusters of <i>regheth</i> here and there.</p>

<p>This was one of the worst bits of the Robat-Nushki
road. The sand was troublesome and
the track absolutely obliterated by it in this
portion. Twenty-three miles, 660 yards from
Mukak we arrived at Sahib Chah, a spot which
no traveller is ever likely to forget, especially if a
few drops of water from one of the wells are
tasted. When the road was made it was very
difficult to find drinkable water in this part, and
this well&mdash;renowned all over Beluchistan and
Sistan for its magic powers&mdash;has up to the
present time been the only successful attempt;
but I understand from Captain Webb-Ware,
who is in charge of the road, that he hopes to
find or has found water further north, on the
other side of the hill range, and that in future
the traveller will be spared the good fortune of
visiting this heavenly spot.</p>

<p>Most attractive iron troughs had been brought
here and placed near the four wells, and up-to-date
wooden windlasses had been erected on the
edge of each well&mdash;conveniences that were not
quite so common at the stations we had already
passed. This may lead the unwary traveller to
believe that the water of these wells must have
some special charm.</p>

<p>One well was, fortunately, absolutely dry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-335" id="Pg_2-335"></a>[<a href="./images/2-335.png">335</a>]</span>
The water of two was so powerful in its lightning
effects that unfortunate was the wretch who
succumbed to the temptation of tasting it; while
the water of the fourth well, one was told, was of
a quite good drinking kind. I had been warned
not to touch it, but my men and camels drank
some and it had equally disastrous effects on men
and beasts. Sadek, who was requested to experiment
and report on such occasions, thought his
last hour had come, and he and the camel men
moaned and groaned the greater part of the night.
The water seemed not only saturated with salt, but
tasted of lead and phosphorus, and was a most
violent purgative.</p>

<p>The rest-house could not be called luxurious;
the reader is referred to the photograph I took of
it facing page <a href="#Pg_2-332">332</a>. It was roofless&mdash;which, personally,
I did not mind&mdash;and the walls just high
enough to screen one from the wind and sand. It
was in two compartments, the wall of one being
4&frac12; feet high, and of the other about 7 feet high,
while 15 feet by 8 feet, and 10 feet by 8 feet
were the respective dimensions of each section.</p>

<p>The place lies in the middle of a valley amid
hills of chalk or gypsum and deep soft sand, and
is screened by a low hill range to the north-east
and north, while a low flat-topped sand dune
protects it on the south-west. The new track,
I believe, will go north of the north-east range.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> all my camels as well as my men had been
very sick during the night; as we had a long
march before us the following day, and as I
wished to take a photograph of the place, I
resolved not to leave until the sun had risen, and
in order to avoid delay I despatched all the
camels and loads, except my camera, at four
o'clock in the morning, meaning to walk some
ten or fifteen miles, and thus give my own camel
a rest. Sadek, who said it was not right for a
servant to ride when his master walked, refused
to go on with the caravan and insisted on remaining
with me.</p>

<p>When the camels left&mdash;there was a cutting
northerly wind blowing raising clouds of sand&mdash;I
retreated to the shelter to wait for the sun to rise,
and had a few hours' sleep in a solitary blanket I
had retained. The track had so far been so well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-337" id="Pg_2-337"></a>[<a href="./images/2-337.png">337</a>]</span>
defined that I never thought of asking Mahommed
which way it led out of these hills.</p>

<p>The sun having risen, and the photograph of
Sahib Chah shelter duly taken, we proceeded to
catch up the camels, but a few yards from the
shelter all signs of the track ceased, and even the
footprints of my camels had been absolutely
obliterated by the high wind of the morning.
To the east-south-east were rather high rocky
hills and two passes, one going round to the
north-north-east (which apparently would take
us away from our direction), and another east-south-east,
which seemed more likely to be the
right one. To mislead us more we saw what
we believed to be faint camel tracks smothered
in sand in this direction, so on we went, sinking
in fine sand, which kept filling our shoes and
made walking most uncomfortable.</p>

<p>I climbed to the top of the rocky hill to reconnoitre,
but higher hills stood all round barring
the view, and I was none the wiser. On we
went&mdash;certain that we were going wrong, but
unable to find where the track was. Among
hundreds of sand hills, dunes, and high parallel
hill ranges it was not easy to discover it.</p>

<p>There were flat stretches of sand and parallel
dunes several hundred feet high stretching from
north by north-west to south by south-east, and
as I knew the way must be east we had to go
over them, down on the other side, only to be
confronted with others before us like the waves
of a stormy sea.</p>

<p>The sun was scorching, and when the sand got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-338" id="Pg_2-338"></a>[<a href="./images/2-338.png">338</a>]</span>
hot, too, walking was most unpleasant. When
we were not on sand while ascending the hill
slopes and tops we were on cutting shale. Sadek,
who had not yet recovered from his previous
night's experience at Sahib Chah, was still sick,
and with the extra exertion somehow or other
lost his head altogether.</p>

<p>After having gone up and down, I should not
like to say how many times, we were confronted
by a flat valley to the south-west and more
mountains to be crossed in the direction we
were going, to the north-east. Sadek thereupon
maintained that the track must perforce be along
the valley, to which I would not agree, and I
insisted on keeping east, which I knew would
bring us right in the end. As we climbed hill
after hill, Sadek dragged himself behind me
with a discontented face, every few minutes
glancing back at the distant flat valley to the
south-west, to which he pointed, sighing:
"Good master, that's road!"</p>

<p>But up and down we continued, away from it,
eastwards, range after range of hills being left
behind and more ranges standing in front of us.
Sadek, who was sweating under the weight of
the rifle and camera, grumbled that he was ill
and tired, hungry and thirsty, and it was very
little consolation to think that from this spot,
the two nearest wells of drinkable water were
distant one about twenty-eight miles, the other
over forty miles. We had nothing whatever
with us to eat or drink.</p>

<p>After some three hours of uncertainty&mdash;and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-339" id="Pg_2-339"></a>[<a href="./images/2-339.png">339</a>]</span>
must confess that it was somewhat trying each
time we had reached the top of a range, which
we climbed with anxious enthusiasm, expecting
to get a glimpse of the track, to find our view
obstructed by yet another range, generally higher
than the one on which we stood,&mdash;after hours of
toiling, as I was saying, we now came to a rocky
range about double the height of any we had
climbed so far.</p>

<p>Sadek, on looking at it, declined to climb any
more. He said he knew the track must be in
the opposite direction and we should only have
to climb all these hills back again. He sat down
and puffed away at cigarettes to allay his hunger
and thirst and soothe his temper, while I climbed
to the highest point, some 480 feet, above the
point where I had left Sadek. Behold! on
reaching the summit, beyond another range lower
to the north, along a wide undulating plain I did
discern a whitish streak like a chalk line stretching
from west to east,&mdash;unmistakably the road.</p>

<p>I signalled the news to Sadek, and shouted to
him to come up, which he most reluctantly did.
When panting half-way up the hill, he still
turned round to the south-west and disconsolately
exclaimed, "No can be road, my good master.
That is road!" (to the south-west). I ordered
him to hurry up to my point of vantage and see
for himself.</p>

<p>"May be road, may be not road," was his
obstinate verdict, when the white streak across the
plain was triumphantly pointed out to him.</p>

<p>"But, Sadek, can you not see the white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-340" id="Pg_2-340"></a>[<a href="./images/2-340.png">340</a>]</span>
perfectly straight line stretching along, straighter
than anything else around you?"</p>

<p>"I can see plenty white lines, master. <i>Up-stairs</i>
mountains, <i>down-stairs</i> mountains"&mdash;(by
which he meant gypsum strata on the top and
foot of hills). "May be," he added, sarcastically,
"all roads to Shalkot (Quetta)!"</p>

<p>"Can you not see that the white track leads
exactly in the direction where my compass says
we must go?"</p>

<p>"Pfff! Compass no good!" he exclaimed with
an air of amusing superiority, and he stooped to
pick two pebbles of different colours. "Take
one of these in one hand, and one in the other,"
he asked of me. "Now throw one towards the
east and one towards the west."</p>

<p>I having for curiosity's sake complied with
his request, he gravely examined the discarded
stones.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib, your compass speaks truth! Allah
says yours is the right road!"</p>

<p>On requesting an explanation of this novel
method of locating positions, Sadek looked very
solemn, and with a pause, as if he were about to
pour forth words of great wisdom, and disregarding
altogether the fact that my efforts solely and
simply were responsible for discovering the track,
"You see, my master," he said, "one stone I
called <i>good road</i>, the other I called <i>no road</i>.
Whichever stone you throw first is Allah's wish.
Allah is more right than compass."</p>

<p>At any rate the method was simple enough,
and it fortunately happened that Allah and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-341" id="Pg_2-341"></a>[<a href="./images/2-341.png">341</a>]</span>
compass seemed in agreement on that occasion;
so adding these circumstances to the more substantial
fact that we could see the track plainly
before us, we gaily descended from our lofty
pinnacle, and with renewed vigour climbed the
lower and last hill range, the last obstacle before
us.</p>

<p>In the trough between the two ranges, however,
the fine sand was extremely nasty, almost
as bad as quicksand, and we had some trouble
in extricating ourselves. We sank into it almost
up to the waist. We then crossed the broad
plain in a diagonal for nearly four miles, and at
last, after some seven hours of anxiety, not to
speak of hunger and thirst, we struck the road
again.</p>

<p>Sadek, who, notwithstanding Allah's patent
method, my compass bearings, and our combined
eyesight, was not at all certain in his own heart
that we should find the road that day, was so
overcome with joy when he actually recognised
my camel's footprints upon the sand, where not
obliterated by the wind, that he collapsed upon
the ground from fatigue and strain, and slept
snoring sonorously for nearly two hours.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, a Beluch horseman
travelling towards Mushki-Chah had overtaken
my camels, and much to Mahommed's astonishment,
informed him that he had not seen the
Sahib on the road, so Mahommed, fearing that
something had happened, had the sense to turn
back with two camels to try and find us. We
were very glad of a lift when he arrived, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-342" id="Pg_2-342"></a>[<a href="./images/2-342.png">342</a>]</span>
even more glad to partake of a hearty lunch,
and a long, long drink of water, which although
brackish tasted quite delicious, from one of the
skins.</p>

<p>The track was like a whitish streak on a
sombre grey valley, with black hills scattered
here and there, and a most peculiar dome-like
hill on our left (10&deg; b.m.) towards the north.
Eastwards we could see a long flat high table
mountain, not unlike Kuh-i-Kwajah of Sistan.
On our right were low, much broken-up hills;
to the west, low sand hillocks, and facing us,
north-east-east (80&deg; b.m.) a low black hill range
standing in front of some high and very pointed
peaks. To the south-east there was an open
space.</p>

<p>We made a diagonal crossing over several
sand dunes that stood from 50 to 80 feet high,
and extended to a great length southwards.
Then we approached the curious-domed hill.
It was of a warm reddish-brown colour, with
a yellow belt of sand at its base, and half-a-dozen
sugar-loaf sand hills to the west of it. To the
east of it rose the flat-topped plateau, yellowish
at the two extremities, as one looked at it from
this point, and black in the centre. On the
north-east (at 70&deg; b.m.) was a pointed peak,
perfectly conical.</p>

<p>It was a very long march to Mushki-Chah,
and we had a few mild excitements on the road.
We came across some picturesque Beluch, clothed
in flowing white robes, and carrying long matchlocks
with a fuse wound round the stock. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-343" id="Pg_2-343"></a>[<a href="./images/2-343.png">343</a>]</span>
were extremely civil, all insisting on shaking
hands in a most hearty fashion, and seeming very
jolly after they had gravely gone through the
elaborate salutation which always occupies a
considerable time.</p>

<p>Further on we met a cavalcade, which included
the Naib Tashildar of Mirjawa, an
Afghan in British employ, and the <i>duffadar</i> of
Dalbandin, the latter a most striking figure with
long curly hair hanging over his shoulders.
They were with some levies hastening to Mirjawa,
an important place, which, owing to the
ridiculous fashion in which the Perso-Beluch
Commission under Sir T. Holdich had marked
out the frontier, was now claimed both by Persia
and Beluchistan as making part of their respective
territories.</p>

<p>When I was at the Perso-Beluch frontier there
was much ado about this matter, and some trouble
may be expected sooner or later. Anybody who
happens to know a few facts about the way in
which the frontier line was drawn must regret
that England should not employ upon such
important missions sensible and capable men
whose knowledge of the country is thorough.</p>

<p>It would, no doubt, be very interesting to the
public to be told in detail <i>exactly how</i> the frontier
was fixed, and whether Sir T. Holdich, who was
in charge, <i>ever</i> visited the whole frontier line.
The Government maps which existed at the time
of the frontier demarcation were too inaccurate
to be of any use, as has been proved over and
over again to our sorrow. It would also be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-344" id="Pg_2-344"></a>[<a href="./images/2-344.png">344</a>]</span>
interesting to know whether the astronomical
positions of some of the supposed principal points
of the boundary have been accurately tested, and
whether some points which had been corrected
by really efficient officers have been omitted, if
not suppressed, in order to cover certain discrepancies.
And if so whether it was an expedient
to avoid showing the weakness of the
maps (on which certain names figure prominently)
which were taken as a basis for the delineation?</p>

<p>The facts are too commonly known by all the
officers in Beluchistan and by the Foreign Office
in Calcutta, as well as by Persians, to be kept a
secret. It is painful to have to register facts of
this kind, but I most certainly think it is the
duty of any Englishman to expose the deeds of
men who obtain high sounding posts and can
only manage to keep them by intrigue and by
suppressing the straightforward work of really
able officers (which does not agree with theirs)
to the eventual expense and loss of the country at
large.</p>

<p>As we went along, leaving the plain which we
had crossed for some fifteen miles, we saw to the
south-west large white patches like snow. These
were made of gypsum and white limestone covering
the ground. A curious long, low, flat hill,
with hundreds of vertical black streaks at its base
and a black summit, resembled a gigantic centipede
crawling on the flat desert. At the eastern
end of the long plain were mud-hills on the left
side of the track, and black, isolated, rounded
mounds on the right. To the south-east a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-345" id="Pg_2-345"></a>[<a href="./images/2-345.png">345</a>]</span>
curious mountain could be seen, one side of
which was of beautiful white and yellow marble,
and from this spot we crossed hills of sand and
gravel, and the track was more tortuous, but
still travelling in a general direction of east-south-east
(110&deg; b.m.)</p>

<p>Other mountains there were, entirely of white
marble, and a great many beautifully tinted
fragments of marble, as well as yellow alabaster,
were strewn about abundantly upon the ground.
We travelled among hillocks for about seven and
a half miles, then emerged again into a plain with
a hill range to our left, but nothing near us on
the south. At the entrance of the valley on our
left stood a curious high natural stone pillar.</p>

<p>By moonlight, but with clouds fast gathering
and threatening rain, we eventually reached
Mushki-Chah at about ten in the evening,
having travelled some 36 miles. The distance
by road from Sahib Chah would have been
28 miles 660 yards. Here we found the remainder
of my caravan which had arrived some
hours previously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mushki-Chah</span> (3,570 feet) is rather more interesting
than other stations we had passed,
because of the greater number of Beluch one saw
about. Here, too, however, one's sojourning
had to be curtailed, for unluckily the water was
not only brackish&mdash;to which one does not object
so much&mdash;but had a sulphurous taste, with a
sickening smell&mdash;not dissimilar from that of an
old-fashioned hospital ward, when the windows
have not been opened for several days. Otherwise
it had no drawback.</p>

<p>There were four filthy pools from which
water was obtainable and which reminded us of
a previous experience at Girdi in Sistan. The
water of one well had a nasty green coating on
the surface; the second was of a deep yellow
colour. The other two wells were slightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-347" id="Pg_2-347"></a>[<a href="./images/2-347.png">347</a>]</span>
cleaner but they, too, were of a suspicious colour&mdash;that
of strong tea. A cluster of a dozen palm
trees or so had grown near this water, and a little
way beyond on a sand and gravel bank was a
Ziarat with a low surrounding wall of black stones.</p>

<p>The Ziarat was of an ovoid shape, it just
missed being circular, about 18 feet long and 16
feet broad. An entrance had been made to the
east and a sort of altar constructed to the west by
north west&mdash;which is about the accurate direction
of Mecca from this spot. A high pole on which
flew red, white, and blue rags was fixed into the
altar. The altar&mdash;if one may call it so&mdash;was a
mass of blocks of beautifully coloured marble.
Some pieces resembled the best Sienna marble,
others were capriciously streaked in white and
dark brown; other large pieces were quite transparent
and resembled large blocks of camphor or
ice. Others were more granular, like lumps of
frozen snow. Then there were some lovely bits
of a greenish yellow marble and some brown.
These beautiful stones and pieces of marble were
brought to these Ziarats from great distances by
devotees. Stones reduced by nature into queer
shapes, hollowed for instance by the action of
sand or water, perfectly spherical, or strikingly
coloured were favourite offerings.</p>

<p>At this particular Ziarat, a small marble mortar
with pestle and a marble hammer, occupied the
most prominent place. A flint arrow head was
also in evidence. Further was perched a curious
doll with a string and charm round its neck, and
some chips of beautiful transparent streaked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-348" id="Pg_2-348"></a>[<a href="./images/2-348.png">348</a>]</span>
yellow marble like bits of lemon. From the
pole hung a circle of wood and horns, as well as
coarse wooden imitations of horned animals'
skulls. Offerings of palm leaves had also been
deposited.</p>

<p>West of the Ziarat was a small semicircular
Mesjid of brown stone, with a few white marble
pieces to the north by north-west, and, further,
long heaps of stones extending in a north by
north-west direction. The last one was in the
shape of a grave with a high white stone pillar
to the south.</p>

<p>The new bungalow, of which the foundations
were just being laid, will be erected near this
Ziarat.</p>

<p>Quite a number of Beluch were settled at
Mushki-Chah, and some lived in small quadrangular
mud houses, with a black tent stretched
over the walls to act as roof; or else they had
put up coarse huts made of branches of tamarisk
and thatched with palm tree leaves and tamarisk,
in which they lived&mdash;apparently in the most
abject poverty. Yet, although these residences
were often not higher than five or six feet, their
owners did not lack pride. In Beluchistan as in
England, the home of a man is his castle. The
Beluch, however&mdash;most unlike the English&mdash;would
not let anybody who did not belong to
his creed go into it.</p>

<p>The occupations of the stay-at-home people
did not seem to have an excess of variety, and
consisted mainly of plaiting fuses for their
matchlocks, keeping the threads tightly stretched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-349" id="Pg_2-349"></a>[<a href="./images/2-349.png">349</a>]</span>
by means of a wooden bow. There were but
few coarse implements inside their huts, and a
bag or two with grain. A long matchlock and
a sword or two lay in a corner in most dwellings,
and that was about all.</p>

<p>The house of the chief was somewhat more
elaborate, having trunks of palm trees inserted
vertically into the stone wall to strengthen it.
It had a mud and stone enclosing wall, and
trophies of heads of <i>dumbahs</i> near the flat roof.
In one room of this dwelling lived the family, in
the other the animals. An out-of-door enclosure
for horses was also noticeable. Two mud huts
were next to it.</p>

<p>The thatched semispherical huts of palm tree
leaves and tamarisk were also interesting, as was
the windmill, identical with those already seen
in Sistan.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Mushki-Chah two large
tents had been placed at my disposal&mdash;the first
time I had been under a tent on this journey&mdash;and
I received a great many callers. A very
amusing incident occurred when I asked an old
Beluch and his two sons to sit for their photographs.
They put on a sarcastic smile and said
they would rather die a natural death than be
taken. The old man, who said he had heard all
about "the black boxes," as he styled cameras,
and all the mischief they could do, complained
that since one or two sahibs had passed along the
route carrying "black boxes" a great many
Beluch had been taken ill, had misfortunes of all
kinds, and those who actually had the camera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-350" id="Pg_2-350"></a>[<a href="./images/2-350.png">350</a>]</span>
pointed at them had died from the effects. One
sahib had offered him, personally, a bag of silver
if he would only sit for his picture, but "No,
sir, not I!" said the father, as he shook his head
and scratched his beard; and "No, sir, not
we!" echoed the grinning youths, "never shall
we be taken!"</p>

<p>Before they knew where they were, and
without any suspicion on their part, I had, by a
dodge of my own, taken three photographs of
them, the best of which is reproduced facing
page <a href="#Pg_2-350">350</a>.</p>

<p>They were rather characteristic types of the
lower class Beluch of northern Beluchistan.
They possessed very quick, bright, shining eyes,
dark complexions and long noses, very broad at
the base. The mouth was generally the worst
feature in their faces, the upper lip being drawn
very tight over the teeth and giving rather a
brutal expression to their countenances. The
men were very powerfully built, thick-set, with
ribs well covered with muscle and fat, powerful,
coarse wrists and ankles, and square-shaped hands
with short stumpy thumbs.</p>

<p class="illc">Three Beluch who would not be Photographed!</p>

<p>Their attire was simple; a sort of long white
cotton blouse buttoned over the right shoulder
and ample trousers of the same material. Many,
however, wore a felt "overcoat"&mdash;or rather,
"overskin," for there was no other garment
underneath. A white turban was worn wound
round the head.</p>

<p>A <i>duffadar</i>, six <i>sawars</i> and six camels were
stationed at Mushki-Chah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-351" id="Pg_2-351"></a>[<a href="./images/2-351.png">351</a>]</span></p>

<p>I left Mushki-Chah on January 21st at 3.30
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, my camels with loads having started some
hours previously, and our way lay for eight miles
due east, first over sand hills and undulations,
then on a perfectly straight and level track. To
the south we had a barren waste of flat desert.
We then veered east-south-east (110&deg; b.m.), and
fifteen miles off turned slightly further to the
south-east (120&deg; b.m.). To the north-north-east
we had a mountain range.</p>

<p>On nearing Kundi we found tamarisk plentiful
and good grazing for camels. Some of the
tamarisk trees were 10 feet high. The march
was a very cold one, a north-north-west gale
blowing fiercely and penetrating right through
our clothes and flesh to the marrow of our
bones.</p>

<p>Three wells of good water were found 1&frac14;
miles before reaching Kundi. The rest-house
was uninhabited and fast tumbling down.
In 21 miles 1,100 yards we had slightly risen
to 3,660 feet, and this point is one which
remains well impressed on one's mind, partly
on account of the splendid view obtained
of the Sultan Mountains to the north-east&mdash;a
gloomy black mass with the highest peak of a
light red colour. The Kuh-i-Sultan is a most
weirdly fantastic mountain range. Sir Charles
McGregor, who saw these mountains from a
distance, speaks of them as the "oddest-looking
mountains he had ever seen."</p>

<p>But the best description is that given by
Major A. H. MacMahon, who was, I believe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-352" id="Pg_2-352"></a>[<a href="./images/2-352.png">352</a>]</span>
the first European to explore the range. Approaching
it from the north he, too, was struck
by the grotesque shape of its numerous sharp
peaks; above all by the Neza-i-Sultan&mdash;"the
spear of the Sultan"&mdash;an enormous rocky pillar
of hard conglomerate, roughly resembling a slender
sugar-loaf with tapering summit, and precipitous
sides, that rise on the crest line of the
range.</p>

<p>"The fissures," MacMahon says, "made by
rain and weather action down its sides give it
a fluted appearance from a distance. We expected
to find a high natural pillar, but were not
prepared for the stupendous size of the reality.
Judging from its width at the base, which is over
100 yards in diameter, the height must be no
less than from 500 to 800 feet. The Sultan, in
whose honour this range is named, is an ancient
mythical celebrity, who is said to be buried in
the vicinity of the mountains. His full name is
Sultan-i-Pir-Khaisar, and he is the patron saint
of Beluch robbers. Hence these mountains have
a reputation as a robber resort. The Sultan
Mountains abound in the assafoetida plant, and
in the summer months traders come in numbers
from Afghanistan to collect it."</p>

<p>I was in a great hurry to return to England,
and could not afford the detour entailed by going
near enough to photograph the "Spear." Besides,
Major MacMahon gives a capital photograph
of it in the <i>Royal Geographical Society's
Journal</i>.</p>

<p>At Kundi, a big Ziarat, with many trunks of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-353" id="Pg_2-353"></a>[<a href="./images/2-353.png">353</a>]</span>
tamarisk trees, some 10 feet high, supporting
bleached horns, has been erected to the Kuh-i-Sultan.
Hundreds of beautiful pieces of marble
and alabaster of all sizes, colours and shapes have
been deposited here, as usual, but the sand is fast
covering the whole Ziarat.</p>

<p>From Kundi the track, which has come in a
south-east-east (120&deg; b.m.) direction, now turned
sharply to north-east (60&deg; b.m.). Ten high
mud and stone <i>neshans</i>&mdash;or <i>Tejia</i> (cairns) as they
are called by the Beluch&mdash;have been erected
to warn the traveller. Four curious mounds
with tufts of high tamarisk trees upon them are
to be seen at Kundi. There is fair grazing for
camels all along. One is specially attracted by
the peculiar stones corroded into all sorts of
shapes, strewn all over the ground.</p>

<p>We made a double march on that day, and&mdash;barring
the quaint Sultan Mountains which we
saw all along&mdash;had but a very flat uninteresting
country all round.</p>

<p>We arrived during the evening at Tretoh, having
been nineteen hours on the saddle. It was
bitterly cold at night, the drop in the temperature
being very great immediately after the sun
went down. At this station, too, the water
tasted very bad&mdash;almost undrinkable&mdash;but was
not necessarily unwholesome. We were glad
to get into the thana and light up a big fire in
the centre of one of the mud rooms, but no sooner
had we done this than it got so hot that I had to
find a cooler abode in the new bungalow in
course of construction, which had not yet a roof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-354" id="Pg_2-354"></a>[<a href="./images/2-354.png">354</a>]</span></p>

<p>It was always a marvel to me how the natives
could stand the great heat in the rooms with no
draught for the smoke and heat to get away. It
positively roasted one alive, but my men seemed
to revel in it. On the other hand they suffered
from the cold to a degree that was also unaccountable
to me. On many occasions I have
heard my camel-driver moan from pain in his
frozen toes and fingers, but, true enough, when
out in the open desert the wind was rather penetrating,
and his clothes, barring a waistcoat, consisted
of thin white cotton garments. Personally,
I never had occasion to make a change in my
tropical clothing (I could not if I had wanted
to), nor did I ever once have to use an overcoat.
But&mdash;I seldom know what it is to feel cold.</p>

<p>We delayed our departure the next morning to
see if the gale would abate, but at 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we had
to venture out. One was rather at the mercy of
the wind on the hump of the camel. It did
blow! The wind hampered the camels greatly
and was a nuisance all round, as one could only
by an effort remain on the saddle. The flying
sand filled one's eyes and ears, and the wind
catching the brim of one's hat made such a hissing
noise that one had to find a more comfortable
headgear by wrapping up one's head in a
blanket.</p>

<p>The desert was here absolutely flat, with some
grazing for camels (<i>kirri</i>). We were going north-east-east
(70&deg; b.m.) amid low sand hillocks and
sand banks, and the Sultan Mountain still on our
left in all its glory. To the north-east (55&deg; b.m.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-355" id="Pg_2-355"></a>[<a href="./images/2-355.png">355</a>]</span>
we had another mountain mass lower than the
Sultan and not nearly so picturesque, and before
us, on going over a gentle incline some 35 ft.
above the level of the plain (about 13 miles
from Tretoh), three long rows of bright yellow,
flat-topped, crescent-shaped sand-hills stretching
for several miles from north to south were disclosed.
These three rows of barchans were
parallel, and at intervals of about from 300
yards to 500 yards from one another. The
barchans averaged from 50 ft. to 100 ft. in
height. Another row of them stretched along
the foot of the mountain range to the north
and extended from north-west to south-east.</p>

<p>The cause of these extensive parallel rows
of barchans was to be found in gaps in the hills
to the north between the Sultan, the next range,
and two intervening obstacles in the shape of a
low mound and a great rock, the sand being
blown through the interstices and gradually
accumulating in the plain on the south.</p>

<p>On that march we saw a most extraordinary
effect of mirage. To the east (100&deg; b.m.) the
peculiar flat-topped Gat (or Gut) Mountain,
which looked like a gigantic lamp-shade, could
be seen apparently suspended in the air. The
illusion was perfect, and most startling to any
one with teetotal habits. Of course the optical
illusion was caused by the different temperatures
in the layers of air directly over the earth's surface
and the one above it. Where the two layers
met they deviated at an angle, or practically
interrupted what would, under ordinary circum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-356" id="Pg_2-356"></a>[<a href="./images/2-356.png">356</a>]</span>stances,
be direct rays of vision. (The same
effect, in other words, as produced by placing
a stick vertically in water.) The real horizon
was obliterated, as well as the lower part of the
mountain, by the white haze caused by the warm
lower layer of air.</p>

<p>Some nineteen miles from Tretoh, where the
hill range to the north became low, a few sand
hills were to be seen, then where another gap
existed in the range yet another long row of
barchans stretched southwards. A mile or so
beyond this spot a long sand and gravel bank
stretched across the plain from north-north-east to
south-south-west and near Chah Sandan another
similar bank existed, fifty feet high, parallel to
the first.</p>

<p>At Chah Sandan (altitude 3,380 ft.) we were
most enthusiastically received by the <i>duffadar</i>,
who was politeness itself. The Beluch salutation
is somewhat lengthy. In the Ba-roh-iya or
Brahui language, as spoken in north Beluchistan
where I was travelling, it sounds thus:&mdash;"<i>Shar
joroz druakha joroz haire meretus me murev huaja
khana</i>," after which the persons greeting seize
each other's hands and raise them to the forehead,
bowing low. Inquiries follow about the
<i>mulk</i> or countries one has crossed on one's
journey, and whether the people have treated one
kindly.</p>

<p>The <i>duffadar</i> at Chah Sandan was an Afghan,
Belind Khan by name, and had the following
good points about him. He was a most sportsmanlike
fellow; was very bright, civil and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-357" id="Pg_2-357"></a>[<a href="./images/2-357.png">357</a>]</span>
intelligent, and owned chickens that laid delicious
eggs. He possessed a beautiful dog to which
he was passionately attached, and he and his
brother had a greater capacity for tea than
almost any men I have known. Above all,
Belind Khan had intense admiration for the
British and what they did, and as for Captain
Webb-Ware, his superior officer, he pronounced
him to be the greatest "Bahadur" that ever
lived. "Even in my own country (Afghanistan),"
he exclaimed, raising his right hand in
the air, "there is no 'Bahadur' like him!"</p>

<p>This was not pure flattery but it was truly
meant, and it was most pleasant to find that such
was the opinion, not only of Belind Khan, but of
every one of Captain Webb-Ware's subordinates
on the entire length of the road from the frontier
to Quetta.</p>

<p>There is a <i>thana</i> of three rooms at Chah
Sandan and a Ziarat to the Sultan Mountain. I
took a photograph of Belind Khan making his
salaams in the Ziarat, the altar of which was
made of a pile of white marble pieces and
rounded stones with sticks on which horns and
a red rag had been fixed.</p>

<p>Chah Sandan possessed three wells of excellent
water. The distance from Tretoh to Chah
Sandan was 23 miles 760 yards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Due</span> east of Chah Sandan was the Gat mountain,
this time, as there was no mirage, duly
resting upon the desert. It was a most attractive
looking mountain, and quite one of the most
striking sights in the scenery upon the Nushki-Robat
road.</p>

<p>Five miles from Chah Sandan we again struck
high, flat-topped sandbanks, and a great many
conical sand hills. Ten miles off we went
through a cut in the hills near which are to be
found a well of brackish water and a great many
palm trees, of two kinds (<i>Pish</i> and <i>Metah</i>).
Big tamarisks (<i>kirri</i>) were also abundant, and
there was good grazing for camels, <i>regheth</i>
being plentiful. Near the salt well stood a
gigantic palm tree.</p>

<p>We had come east-north-east (70&deg; b.m.) from
Chah Sandan, and from this, our nearest point to
the Gat mountain, the track turned east-south-east<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-359" id="Pg_2-359"></a>[<a href="./images/2-359.png">359</a>]</span>
(110&deg; b.m.). One really had to halt to look at
the Gat, it was so impressive. Two enormous
blocks of rock several hundred feet high, one,
roughly speaking, of a quadrangular shape (to
the north) and one rectangular (to the south),
were joined on the east side by a perpendicular
wall of solid rock. Up to about two-thirds of
the height of the mountain these huge blocks
had accumulations of debris and sand, forming
a slanting pad all round except on the west side,
where there was a sort of hollow recess.</p>

<p>There was a large plain with good camel
grazing to the east-south-east, bounded from east
to south by a semicircle of low hills.</p>

<p>After leaving Gat there was nothing of interest
on the march. Another extensive sand bank,
50 feet high, forming the eastern part of the
hilly semicircle above mentioned, was crossed,
then we were in a barren valley. Further on,
however, after going over yet another sand dune
(extending from north to south) we entered one
more plain, this time absolutely covered with low
palm trees. From this plain we began to rise in
order to cross the hill range that stood before us,
and here there were innumerable sand hills and
sand banks, the latter facing north.</p>

<p>Near Mirui one found one's self among strange-looking
mountains, some like huge waves of
sand, debris, and shale; one to the left, a huge
flat-topped mass in horizontal well-marked strata,
while further on was a third, a most perfect
cone. Behind this to the south lay a mass of
lower pointed conical sand hills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-360" id="Pg_2-360"></a>[<a href="./images/2-360.png">360</a>]</span></p>

<p>Mirui being one of the more important stages
on the road, a most comfortable large bungalow
has been erected here, like the one at Robat,
with four rooms and four bath rooms, kitchens,
etc. The water is very good at this place;
there is a shop with the usual supplies for
caravans, and a staff consisting of a <i>jemadar</i>,
a <i>duffadar</i>, one postal moonshee, seven <i>sawars</i>,
four <i>hasildars</i>, one <i>havildar</i>. The bungalow at
Mirui is most picturesquely situated among the
quaint mountains, and the six-roomed <i>thana</i>
some little distance below, against the mountain
side, looks quite formidable. It not only has
high towers at the corners of the wall, but
possesses an additional watch tower erected on
the top of the mountain, commanding a fine
view of the country around. Before it, surrounded
by hills, spreads a valley from north to
south, which the track crosses in a south-south-west
direction among palms and plentiful high
tamarisks.</p>

<p>The bungalow stood at an altitude of 3,500
feet, the valley where the <i>thana</i> was situated was
one hundred feet lower (3,400 feet), and the
steep although not high pass by which we left
the valley 3,550 feet.</p>

<p>A short zig-zag led us into a second valley
with a sand bank barring our way directly in
front to the south-east (125&deg; b.m.), the direction
of the track. For a change we had high precipitous
cliffs on the north and a low range of
sand hills extending from north-north-east to
south-south-west. Two very lofty isolated peaks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-361" id="Pg_2-361"></a>[<a href="./images/2-361.png">361</a>]</span>
broke the monotony of the horizon line to the
north-east (to 70&deg; and 80&deg; respectively). Having
crossed a third and a fourth plain, two barren,
the other at the foot of a sandbank with plenty
of tamarisk, the track, which for a short distance
went east, turned suddenly to the north-east
(70&deg; b.m.).</p>

<p>We had now a great expanse of open country
before us with abundant tamarisk, palm trees,
and <i>eshwark</i>, which made capital grazing for
camels. Three high red mounds stood respectively
to the south-east, south, and south-west,
while almost north (350&deg;) the two high pointed
conical peaks we had observed on the previous
march were again visible. On the south-east
there was quite a high mountain range.</p>

<p>This was a region of sand banks, all facing
north, only one out of the lot spreading in a
south-south-west direction, and of semi-spherical
sand hills which were also numerous.</p>

<p>On getting near Sotag the sandy ground was
so covered with gypsum that for some distance
it looked just as if it had snowed. The photograph
reproduced in the illustration gives a good
idea of the scenery in that part.</p>

<p>Some three and a half miles from Sotag a gap
in the hills afforded a view of an extensive plain
to the south, with innumerable reddish-yellow
sand hills, and a range of high mountains far
away beyond. From this point the track rises
gently over an undulation about 88 feet higher
than the plain, and on the other side undulations
continue, and nothing whatever is to be seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-362" id="Pg_2-362"></a>[<a href="./images/2-362.png">362</a>]</span>
except the same range of hills to the south, with
its peaks assuming pyramidical shapes toward
the eastern portion.</p>

<p>We passed the salt well of Jujiki about half
way between the two stations, and arrived at the
desolate shed of Chakal at nine in the evening,
where the thatched roofs of two out of three of
the rooms had been torn down to supply fuel to
travellers. There is only a salt well at this place,
but some two miles off the road a well of good
water has been dug, near which a new bungalow
has been erected.</p>

<p>But as we arrived late, having done a double
march&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;and as I intended moreover continuing to
Dalbandin after three hours' rest, I did not avail
myself of the convenience. We had carried a
supply of good water with us. There was no
wood here nor grazing for camels, but both fuel
and food for the animals can be obtained at the
Bungalow.</p>

<p>Chakal was at the identical altitude of Mirui,
3,600 feet.</p>

<p>My camels with loads left at midnight, and
some two hours later I followed. This was a
most uninteresting march in a north-east by east
(70&deg;) direction with sand hills on either side of
the track, and high distant mountains to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-363" id="Pg_2-363"></a>[<a href="./images/2-363.png">363</a>]</span>
south&mdash;a red stretch of flat sand between extending
all along from north-east to south-west.
When there were no more sand hills we came to
sand banks, which made the track undulating
like a switchback railway.</p>

<p>Our attention was drawn to a curious plant
with a fruit resembling small oranges lying upon
the ground and called by the natives <i>karenghi
rirri</i>. There were hundreds of these fruit about,
but Mahommed, who had great local botanical
knowledge, advised me not to eat them because
their poison was deadly, and we did not care to
experiment in order to test the accuracy of his
statement.</p>

<p>All along this Robat-Nushki route one finds a
great many <i>Mesjids</i> (or <i>Masit</i>, as the word is
pronounced by the Beluch). The Mesjid or
Masit is a sort of temporary praying spot where
good Mussulmans say their prayers at sunrise or
sunset, and answers the purpose&mdash;if one may be
allowed the expression&mdash;of an open-air mosque!
The Mesjid may be simple or elaborate, small
or big, according to devoutness, patience and
materials at hand, but its most frequent shape is
circular, or at least more or less regularly curved,
and its material, stones, or if stones are not
obtainable, sand or mud banked up. Looking
to the west towards Mecca is a stone higher
than the others, and in the more elaborate
Mesjids, such as the one shown in the illustration,
a proper kneeling-place to fit the knees is made
on the western side, with a stone in the centre to
mark the exact direction of Mecca. A "revered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-364" id="Pg_2-364"></a>[<a href="./images/2-364.png">364</a>]</span>
tomb" is duly placed in the centre of the larger
Mesjids, and an entrance way into them bordered
with stones is always present. To enter the
Mesjid by stepping over the ledge from any
other side would be considered irreverent. The
interior is always cleared of all stones and made
as smooth as practicable.</p>

<p>There are Mesjids just big enough for one
man, these being frequently made by caravan
men to say their prayers; and there are large
ones for the use of several people. The praying
spot to the west is, however, generally only big
enough for one at a time.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-091.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-091_th.jpg" alt="Circular Mesjid, with Tomb and Outer Kneeling Place." title="Circular Mesjid, with Tomb and Outer Kneeling Place." /></a></p>

<p class="illc">Mesjid on the Site where a Man had been Killed.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Between Kishingi and Morad Khan Kella.)</p>

<p>Then there are the more ornamental constructions
which had a neatly made wall of white
marble enclosed in a case of black stones, a high
black pillar to the west and two small white
marble ones by its side. The entrance in this
case was to the east with a stone slab across it
which was raised when entering the Mesjid.</p>

<p>One Mesjid, or more, are generally to be found
near burial places. Occasionally I have seen
large square or rectangular ones, but they are not
quite so common as those of a rounded shape.
In some cases the Mesjid consists of a mere semicircle
facing towards the west.</p>

<p>The Beluch, as every one knows, is a Suni
Mussulman and nourishes a hatred for the Shia
sect, but although very observant of certain rites
pertaining to the religion of Mahommed, the
Beluch is not bigoted in religious matters, and
this is probably due to the fact that <i>mullahs</i>,
<i>saiyads</i>, <i>fakirs</i> or other such religious officials and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-365" id="Pg_2-365"></a>[<a href="./images/2-365.png">365</a>]</span>
fanatics are seldom to be encountered among the
Beluch in Northern Beluchistan.</p>

<p>Far south in Makran matters are different;
the people are more fanatical, and several religious
sects, such as the <i>Rafais</i>&mdash;a sect which proves its
faith in the prophet by self-inflicted tortures&mdash;the
<i>Khwajah</i> and the <i>Zikris</i> are found, as well as the
"<i>Biadhiah</i>," who are despised as heretics by both
Suni and Shia Mussulmans, and who fully
reciprocate the hatred. Unlike other true
Mussulmans, these Biadhiahs indulge in intoxicants
and are very slack in religious observances.</p>

<p>But the Brahuis&mdash;with whom I mostly came
in contact in the North&mdash;although not very
strict, are certainly most reverent and generally
not intemperate. They have no actual mosques
wherein to go and pray, but worship in the improvised
Mesjids which I have described. In fact, the
word <i>Mesjid</i> merely means "a place of worship."</p>

<p>Superstition is generally rampant in people
leading a somewhat wild life of adventure.
Some of the legends of the good and evil <i>gins</i>,
or spirits and <i>peris</i>, fairies, are very quaint. The
belief in the magic power of spells and charms
is also deeply rooted.</p>

<p>Captain Webb-Ware told me two rather
amusing instances of superstition. One day he
was out stalking in the hills near Dalbandin,
when he came across a snake (<i>ekis carinata</i>).
The Beluch shikars who were with him refused
to go on and sat down for half an hour waiting
for the evil influences&mdash;of which the snake was
a palpable symbol&mdash;to vanish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-366" id="Pg_2-366"></a>[<a href="./images/2-366.png">366</a>]</span></p>

<p>On another occasion one of his men dropped
his knife&mdash;a knife which, by the way, he had
found on the road. The Beluch got off his
camel and stalked the knife as it lay on the
ground, and when within a few feet of it he
let fly a stone at it&mdash;or as near it as he could.
This was, he explained, to hit and hurt the
"pal" which was in the knife, by which he
meant that the knife was "possessed," and a
positive proof of it lay in the fact that he had
dropped it on no less than three separate
occasions.</p>

<p>There was a certain humour in the remark
made by a Beluch at Isa Tahir to Captain
Webb-Ware when he saw the captain's servant,
with an efficient filter, reduce the filthily slimy
water of the only local pool into water as clear
as crystal. He rushed to the captain in a state
of great concern and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Sahib," he said, "do you know what your
servant is doing? He is taking <i>all</i> the colour,
<i>all</i> the strength, and <i>all</i> the smell out of the
water that you are going to drink!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> arrived very early at Dalbandin, the march
from Chakal being very short (18 miles, 190
yards) and easy. Here I had the pleasure of
meeting Captain F. C. Webb-Ware, C.I.E.,
Political Assistant at Chagai, and officer in
charge of the Nushki-Robat road. Not only
has this officer devoted all his time and energy
to making the road, but, being a man of means,
he has personally gone to considerable expense
to "push" the road and make it a success. It
would not have been easy to find a more
practical and sensible man to do the work, and,
considering the difficulties he had to encounter,
it is marvellous with what little expenditure he
has obtained such excellent results.</p>

<p>It is all very well for the usual newspaper
critic&mdash;who generally does not know what he is
writing about&mdash;to complain of this and complain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-368" id="Pg_2-368"></a>[<a href="./images/2-368.png">368</a>]</span>
of that, and declare that something should have
been done in exactly the contrary way to the
way in which it is done. In regard to this
road, any one with any common sense must see
that all that could have been done has been, or
is being, done&mdash;and done well.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-093.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-093_th.jpg" alt="The Type of Thana and New Bungalow between Nushki and Robat." title="The Type of Thana and New Bungalow between Nushki and Robat." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Type of Thana and New Bungalow between Nushki and Robat.</p>

<p>The road itself&mdash;for a desert road&mdash;is excellent
in every way as far as the frontier, and some
sort of shelter is to be found at every stage. Of
course the road has only just been opened and
all the arrangements for the accommodation of
travellers are not quite completed, but large
comfortable bungalows had already been erected&mdash;as
we have seen&mdash;at Robat, Mirui, and
Dalbandin, while smaller buildings of the same
type will shortly be completed at Mall, Kuchaki
Chah, Yadgar Chah, Sotag, and Chah Sandan.
In addition to these, the erection of bungalows
has been taken in hand at Chakal, Tretoh,
Mushki-Chah, Saindak, Kirtaka, and Mahommed
Raza Chah, and it was anticipated that all these
rest houses would be finished before the close
of 1902.</p>

<p>Owing to the great increase in the traffic
upon the route, the accommodation at Mall,
Yadgar Chah, and Karodak, has been nearly
doubled, and two rooms added to the already
extensive <i>thana</i> at Dalbandin, while the Tretoh,
Mushki-Chah, and Mukak posts have been
much enlarged and strengthened.</p>

<p>On the Persian territory the Vice-Consul in
Sistan has erected small shelters, which, although
necessarily not quite so luxurious as those under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-369" id="Pg_2-369"></a>[<a href="./images/2-369.png">369</a>]</span>
the direct control of the British authorities, are
yet quite good enough for any one to spend a
a night in. We have thus a complete belt of
rest-houses extending from Quetta to Sher-i-Nasrya
in Sistan.</p>

<p>Every effort has been made to improve the
water supply upon the road, and new wells are
constantly being sunk. True, the water, all
along the route, is not of the best, but one does
not generally expect to find delicious sweet spring
water in a desert. One thing is, nevertheless,
certain, that the best has been made of given
circumstances. Barring the most trying section
of the route (in Beluchistan territory) between
Mukak and Mushki-Chah, where the water is
really foul, the majority of wells may be more or
less brackish, but, as I have said before, not
necessarily unwholesome. In fact, I have a firm
belief that brackish water is the water one should
drink in the desert to keep healthy, and is the
remedy provided by nature for the purpose of
balancing other ill-effects produced by travelling
over hot, sandy, dry, barren land. Brackish water,
however, should not be confounded nor classified
with dirty water.</p>

<p>There are post offices at the principal stations,
such as Robat, Saindak, Mirui, Dalbandin and
Nushki, and a bi-weekly service links Robat
with Quetta, the time taken to convey letters
being now reduced to 100 hours. A Consular
postal service in connection with this continues
from Robat, <i>via</i> Sher-i-Nasrya, Birjand to
Meshed. There is a parcel-post service, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-370" id="Pg_2-370"></a>[<a href="./images/2-370.png">370</a>]</span>
very convenient "Value payable parcel system,"
as far as Robat and Sistan; but from England
the Post Office will not take the responsibility of
insured parcels beyond Robat.</p>

<p>The Government has granted a most important
concession&mdash;of great value to traders&mdash;by
which money can be remitted to or received
from either Sher-i-Nasrya (Sistan) or Birjand,
through the Consular Treasury, under the charge
of the Vice-Consul for Sistan.</p>

<p>Messrs. McIver, Mackenzie, &amp; Co., of Karachi,
and Mr. Duncan MacBean, of the Punjab Bank,
Quetta, are prepared to act as forwarding agents
for Indian and Persian firms, and the Quetta
Branch of the Punjab Bank is further in business
communication with the Imperial Bank of
Persia, which, as we have seen, has agencies in
the principal cities of West Persia and also in
Meshed.</p>

<p>Another concession, most important to the
stimulation of trade by this overland route, has
been granted by the North Western Railway in
regard to goods despatched from Karachi to
Quetta for export to Persia by the Nushki-Robat
route. From the 1st of April, 1901, a rebate,
equal to one-third of the freight paid, was given
on all goods, such as tea, spices, piece-goods, iron,
kerosene oil, sugar, brass and copper, etc., booked
and carried from Karachi to Quetta for export
to Persia by the Sistan route. The usual charges
are to be paid on forwarding the goods, but on
producing a certificate from the Agency Office
at Quetta that the goods have actually been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-371" id="Pg_2-371"></a>[<a href="./images/2-371.png">371</a>]</span>
despatched to Persia, <i>via</i> Sistan, the amount of
the rebate is refunded.</p>

<p>From the 1st of May, 1901, another concession
came into effect, allowing a similar
rebate of one-third of the actual freight paid on
all goods received at Quetta from Persia by the
Sistan route (a certificate from the Agency Office
at Quetta being required to prove the fact), and
despatched thence to Karachi or Kiamari, or to
North-western Railway stations in the Punjab
and North-west Province, or to stations on
connected lines.</p>

<p>Merchants despatching goods to Persia by the
Nushki-route should be careful to have each of
the original invoices of their goods attested by
some qualified officer at the place from which
the goods are despatched. By doing this they
will find that their goods will be passed through
the Persian Customs at the frontier with no
trouble and no delay. The invoices should be
clearly written in the English or French
languages.</p>

<p>The number of travellers along the Nushki-Sistan
route is gradually increasing, several
officers returning to England travelling by it;
but I was assured that I was the first European
who had travelled on that route in the opposite
direction, viz, from England to Quetta.</p>

<p>Only British subjects and Persians, it is stated,
are allowed to travel on this route, and some
quaint instances of inconceivable official formality
on the part of the Government of India are cited.
For instance, a German was allowed to travel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-372" id="Pg_2-372"></a>[<a href="./images/2-372.png">372</a>]</span>
by the route from Quetta to Sistan, but another
German who wished at the same time to travel
from Sistan to Quetta was arrested at the frontier,
detained some two months in Sistan, and permission
refused.</p>

<p>I myself had quite an amusing experience at a
certain station with a travelling police officer,
who was not aware of my coming, and seemed
in a great state of mind, fearing that I should
prove to be a Russian spy!</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-094.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-094_th.jpg" alt="The Nushki-Robat Track." title="The Nushki-Robat Track." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Nushki-Robat Track.</p>

<p>The only thing to be regretted along this
route, and one which I think will be a perpetual
cause of friction and annoyance with the Persians
and Russians&mdash;as I am sure it would be to us
were we in their case&mdash;is that we should allow
pilgrims to use this trade route in order to visit
the sacred shrine of Imam Raza in Meshed.
The number is so fast increasing that it is
proposed, I believe, to provide special accommodation
for pilgrims at every stage between Quetta
and Robat.</p>

<p>Now, there are pilgrims and pilgrims. Some
are no doubt well-to-do people and deserve to
be looked after; but the greater number are
decrepit, sickly fanatics, burdened with all sorts of
ailments, whose wish it is to go and die and be
buried in the vicinity of the sacred shrine.
Furthermore, not only do the living ones go and
breathe their last in Meshed (or more frequently
upon the road), but among their personal luggage
they try to bring over corpses of relations for
interment in the holy burial place. The passage
of corpses to Persia through Beluchistan is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-373" id="Pg_2-373"></a>[<a href="./images/2-373.png">373</a>]</span>
permitted by the local government, but occasional
attempts are made to smuggle them
through, and it is not a very easy matter to
detect them, not even by the smell of the
corpses, which can be no worse than that of the
living pilgrims. Even at best these parties of
pilgrims are a miserable, half-decomposed lot,
with bundles of filthy rags. When anybody
dies on the road, attempts&mdash;generally successful&mdash;are
invariably made to bring the bodies along.</p>

<p>That we have had, and still have, the plague
in India is a matter we cannot very well hide;
that the passage across the Beluchistan and
Persian deserts should be a sufficient disinfectant
as far as individuals go is also theoretically probable;
but I am not certain that the theory
would apply to the filthy rags and bedding. I
would not speak so feelingly had I not seen
these pilgrims myself.</p>

<p>Now, if we choose to allow these creatures to
bring infection into other countries&mdash;and it must
be remembered that if they do go to the shrine it
is generally because they are infected with some
complaint or other, or actually for the purpose of
dying there&mdash;we ought not to grumble if the
Russians, who see their thickly populated territories
of Transcaspia threatened, enforce upon
the Persian officials the necessity of hampering
the progress of such parties towards Meshed.
Nor can we blame them if, when the Persian
authorities are unable to enforce stringent measures,
they take matters into their own hands,
whether in a strictly legal way or otherwise, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-374" id="Pg_2-374"></a>[<a href="./images/2-374.png">374</a>]</span>
order to prevent these sickly hordes from coming
towards their frontier.</p>

<p>I am sure that if the sacred shrine were in
British territory, and ailing Russian pilgrims
came over bringing bundles of badly-packed
dead relations with them, the outcry in this
country would be general, and we should soon
put a stop to it.</p>

<p>As it is, the provocation to hinder them is
very great, while the benefit that we reap by
letting these wretches through is rather difficult
to detect; they are an expense to the Government
rather than otherwise, not to speak of the
endless bother and annoyance they give our
various officials on the road, for indeed, religious
people, whether Mussulman or Christian or
Buddhist, can make themselves a nuisance for
religion's sake. Moreover, our caravans, following
directly after these funereal parties, have
occasionally fared badly at the hands of the
alarmed natives.</p>

<p>In Sistan, Major Benn was telling me an
amusing incident: one or two members of one
of these fanatical parties died at the Consulate;
the local Persian doctor pronounced it&mdash;or them&mdash;cases
of plague, and the natives were scared to
death for fear that the infection should spread;
and one day when Major and Mrs. Benn were
peacefully riding along the city wall, a number
of people with rifles collected upon the ramparts
and fired a volley with actual bullets over their
heads. It was explained afterwards that the
intention was not to cause the riders any harm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-375" id="Pg_2-375"></a>[<a href="./images/2-375.png">375</a>]</span>
but merely to drive away the "spirits of infection"
which hung over the Consul, who had been
with the pilgrims.</p>

<p>There seems to be a belief that the intense cold
of the winter, the terrific heat of the summer,
and the torrential rains of the autumn, make the
Nushki route impracticable during the greater
part of the year, but nothing could be further
from the truth. One can travel on this route
comfortably at almost any time of the year,
except during the heavy rains, when the desert
becomes a swamp and makes it impossible for
camels to go on. In summer, of course, one has
to travel at night, and in winter it is pleasanter
travelling during the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> details of how the British Government
came to make the Nushki-Robat road may
interest the reader.</p>

<p>After the Afghan war was over, it was supposed
that our boundary extended as far north as the
river Halmund, but we let things slide for many
years and took no steps to extend our influence so
far, and the result was that the Amir of Afghanistan&mdash;who
very rightly regarded Chagai as a most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-377" id="Pg_2-377"></a>[<a href="./images/2-377.png">377</a>]</span>
important strategical position, in fact, almost the
key to the Halmund&mdash;took possession of the
place. In 1896 a commission was sent out to
define the Perso-Beluch frontier properly, and
Major MacMahon, a most thorough and conscientious
officer, was placed in charge of the
mission.</p>

<p>On looking at the map, one might, if unaware
of certain important circumstances, be led rashly
to believe that the natural geographical boundary
between Beluchistan and Afghanistan is along the
course of the river Halmund, or else that it should
follow the watershed of the chain of mountains
extending, from west to east, from the Malek
Siah, the Lahr Kuh, the Kacha Kuh, Mirjawa or
Saindak Mountains, to the mountain mass extending
as far as the Sultan Mountain. One
cannot at first grasp why, when two such excellent
natural boundaries exist, the boundary has
been drawn right across the desert between the
Halmund and these ranges&mdash;where there is
nothing to mark a division except the whitewashed
pillar-posts put up by the boundary
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'commision'">commission</ins>.</p>

<p>This is what would appear, but here is what
really happened. While we were taking no
trouble to spread our influence in that portion of
the country, the Afghans claimed as theirs a
considerable portion of what to-day makes part of
N. Beluchistan. A point which it is well not to
lose sight of is that, after the Sistan Mission of
1872, when General Sir Frederick Goldsmid,
assisted by General Sir Richard Pollock, acted as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-378" id="Pg_2-378"></a>[<a href="./images/2-378.png">378</a>]</span>
arbitrators between the Persian and Afghan
Governments, it was agreed that the Kuh-i-Malek-Siah
(mountains), close to where the
Ziarat has been erected, should mark the most
south-westerly point common to the two countries.
This point being given, when the Beluch-Afghan
Boundary Commission began its work in
March, 1894, they found that the Afghans
claimed a great deal more land as theirs than was
expected.</p>

<p>The line of boundary to be defined from
Gomal to the Persian frontier was some 800
miles, and during the two years which it took to
complete the laying down of the boundary line
the Mission is said to have had very great
trouble with the Afghan Commissioners.</p>

<p>And here one can hardly forbear comparing
the magnificently thorough manner in which
this frontier was fixed, with the shoddy, confused
method in which the Perso-Beluch frontier was
"demarcated"&mdash;if the word can be used in this
case&mdash;by Sir Thomas Holdich at the same
epoch.</p>

<p>In the case of the Afghan-Beluch frontier,
800 miles of frontier line was carefully laid down
under the direction of Captain (now Major)
A. H. MacMahon, to whom Great Britain may
be grateful for possessing to-day several hundred
square miles of land more than she would have
done; and, mark you, these additional square
miles are&mdash;in a way&mdash;strategically the most important
portion to us of Beluchistan. I am
referring to that zone of flat territory, north of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-379" id="Pg_2-379"></a>[<a href="./images/2-379.png">379</a>]</span>
the Mirjawa, Saindak and Sultan Mountains,
which forms a southern barrier to the Afghan
desert, and along a portion of which we have
now built the Nushki-Robat route.</p>

<p>Strategically, more particularly if a railway is
to be constructed, the advantages in gaining that
strip of land on the north side of the mountainous
region cannot be over-estimated, and
only a fearless, but extremely tactful, well-informed
and, above all, able officer like MacMahon
could have scored such an unexpected
success against the very shrewd Afghan Commissioners.
The latter well knew the political
value of the concession, and so did the Amir at
Cabul&mdash;who, angered at hearing of the advantages
gained by the British Commissioners for
their own country, is said to have treated his
representatives in a summary way on their return
to the Afghan capital.</p>

<p>But the line of boundary was laid in an
unmistakable manner. The final agreements and
really <i>accurately</i> drawn maps were signed on
May 14th, 1896, by both the Afghan and
British Commissioners, and there was no going
back on what had been done.</p>

<p>One of the important results of this Boundary
Commission was that we definitely drove the
Afghans out of Chagai, north of which place
the frontier now extends eastwards to the Sarlat
Mountains. The first thing that directed attention
to these remote regions was Nushki, a little
district some 90 miles from Quetta&mdash;a place
most conveniently situated for strategical and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-380" id="Pg_2-380"></a>[<a href="./images/2-380.png">380</a>]</span>
trade purposes. This was an outlying portion of
the Khan of Kelat's territory.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact these people were always
fighting among themselves; they had a bitter
enmity with one another, and their feuds had
accumulated on an ever increasing scale for
centuries. They merely acknowledged the
Khan's authority when it suited their ends.</p>

<p>The Government first requested the Khan or
Kelat to keep the district in order, being a
frontier district, not far from the Afghan boundary,
and notified him that trouble there might
involve trouble with the British Government.
The Khan, however, was helpless, and the
ultimate result was that the Government came
to terms with the Khan and agreed to give him
a quit rent of 9,000 rupees a year&mdash;a sum much
larger than he ever got out of it for himself&mdash;and
took over Nushki from him.</p>

<p>One question frequently asked is: "Who
owns Beluchistan?" To which one might
almost answer: "Yes, who does?"</p>

<p>Like Afghanistan, Nepal, and other such
buffer states, Beluchistan is going through a
somewhat slow but sure process of absorption.
Beluchistan is a mere expression of political
geography, and the country called by that name
has on the west a semi-mythical boundary with
Persia; on the north a real boundary with
Afghanistan; to the south the Arabian Sea,
and to the west, the Brahuic and Lukhi Mountains,
bordering with Sindh and the lower
Dejarath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-381" id="Pg_2-381"></a>[<a href="./images/2-381.png">381</a>]</span></p>

<p>Beluchistan may be subdivided as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>British Beluchistan, with the assigned districts
of Quetta and the Bolan; territories
under the immediate rule of the
Khan of Kelat.</p>

<p>Sarawan and Thalawan, the lands belonging
to the two leading Brahui clans.</p>

<p>The Chiefship of Las Bela.</p>

<p>Makran, Kharan, and the country of the
Beluch tribes, such as the Marris and
Bugtis, along the Punjab and Sind
borders.</p>

<p>Bori and Zhob.</p></div>

<p>We have certain treaties, engagements and
Sanads with the Khan of Kelat and the other
chiefs, and the country&mdash;again I have to use a
paradoxical expression&mdash;may be regarded as a
sort of "dependent independent" state. I can
find no better way of describing it. We have
bought up all the rights held by the chiefs that
were worth buying for our purposes, and while,
theoretically, the country is supposed to be merely
under our "sphere of influence," we might with
our fast-absorbing qualities practically consider it
absolutely our own.</p>

<p>The Brahui Khan of Kelat is the most powerful
ruler in Beluchistan, and the city of Kelat
may be looked upon as the Beluch capital of
Beluchistan. Quetta, of course, is the capital of
British Beluchistan.</p>

<p>The Beluch may be roughly divided into two
great classes, the <i>Brahui</i> and the <i>Nharui</i>, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-382" id="Pg_2-382"></a>[<a href="./images/2-382.png">382</a>]</span>
latter to be subdivided again into the <i>Rinds</i> and
the <i>Numris</i>. These classes, however, are again
to be split up into a great many tribes of different
names.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-095.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-095_th.jpg" alt="A Beluch Family." title="A Beluch Family." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">A Beluch Family.</p>

<p>The meaning of the word <i>Brahui</i> is said to be
"inhabitants of the desert," and of <i>Nharui</i> "men
of the plains." The Nharui profess to be of
Arab origin, and to have come from the west;
and they despise the idea that they are akin to
the Afghans or the Turkomans. Their features
and habits would support this view, and their
language undoubtedly bears traces of strong
western influence if not of actual western origin.
Their being such much finer specimens of men
than the average Persians, may be accounted for
by the fact that during the Arab invasion only
the fittest and finest survived to get as far as
this, and that of these men the Beluch are the
present descendants.</p>

<p>Like all nomads the Beluch are most wonderful
linguists. I met a great many men who knew
three, four or five languages, such as Brahui,
Nharui, Persian, Afghan, and even Hindustani,
and on experiment they showed remarkable
facility for picking up and correctly retaining
words of any foreign language.</p>

<p>The theory that the Brahui&mdash;the most
numerous class in Beluchistan&mdash;are Tartar
mountaineers is, to my mind, incorrect. They
believe themselves to be the aboriginal people
of Beluchistan, and this, I think, is more likely
the case. Their language is quite different from
any of the Nharui dialects. The Nharui tribes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-383" id="Pg_2-383"></a>[<a href="./images/2-383.png">383</a>]</span>
are much given to raids and warfare, and even
last year, when I was going through Beluchistan,
a small war had just been settled by a British
force, sent to suppress the rebels, in conjunction
with a Persian force from Kerman on the other
side.</p>

<p>I cannot speak of the southern tribes as I did
not visit them, but the Brahui with whom I
came in contact, although very fond of a life of
adventure, I invariably found extremely gentlemanly,
hospitable and dignified in every way.
They were men of a splendid type who,
combined determined bravery with the quietest,
softest, most considerate and graceful manner.</p>

<p>The Khan of Kelat is the most powerful ruler,
and with him we have several important treaties.
From the time of Abdullah Khan, in the
eighteenth century, Kelat had been a state
independent of the Delhi Empire, and had
incorporated several provinces. To understand
fully the evolution of Beluchistan into its present
condition I will give a hasty historical review of
the most important occurrences.</p>

<p>The political connection of the British
Government with Kelat commenced during
the time of the grandson of Nasir Khan, Mehrab
Khan, a weak ruler who became Khan in 1819.
He was disliked by the chiefs of the various
tribes for being under the influence of a man of
low extraction called Daud Mahommed, for
whom Fateh Mahommed, the hereditary
Minister, was sacrificed. Fateh's son, Naib
Mulla Mahommed Hasan, however, murdered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-384" id="Pg_2-384"></a>[<a href="./images/2-384.png">384</a>]</span>
the intruder and was himself placed in the
position his father should have occupied, but his
hatred for the Khan never ceased to crave for
revenge. In 1838 this treacherous Minister, in
the Khan's name, but without his knowledge,
incited the tribes to rise and harm the British
troops in their march to restore Shah Shujia to
his dominions.</p>

<p>Sir Alexander Burns had to be deputed to
Kalat to prevent hostility and attempt to negotiate
a treaty. The treaty contained the following
stipulations.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"(Art. 1.) The descendants of Nasir Khan, as
well as his tribe and sons, shall continue in future
to be masters of the country of Kelat, Kachki,
Khorstan, Makran, Kej, Bela and the port of
Soumiani, as in the time of the lamented Ahmad
Shah Durani.</p>

<p>"(Art. 2.) The English Government will
never interfere between the Khan, his dependants
and subjects, and particularly lend no assistance
to Shah Nawaz Fateh Khan, and the descendants
of the Mahabbatzai branch of the family, but
always exert itself to put away evil from his
house. In case of H. M. the Shah's displeasure
with the Khan of Kelat, the English Government
will exert itself to the utmost to remove the
same in a manner which may be agreeable to
the Shah and according to the rights of the
Khan.</p>

<p>"(Art. 3.) As long as the British Army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-385" id="Pg_2-385"></a>[<a href="./images/2-385.png">385</a>]</span>
continues in the country of Khorasan, the British
Government agrees to pay to Mehrab Khan the
sum of 150,000 of Company's rupees from the
date of this engagement by half yearly instalments.</p>

<p>"(Art. 4.) In return for this sum the Khan,
while he pays homage to the Shah and continues
in friendship with the British nation, agrees to
use his best endeavours to procure supplies,
carriage and guards to protect provisions and
stores going and coming from Shikarpur by
the route of Rozan Dadar, the Bolan pass,
through Shal to Kuchlak from one frontier to
another."</p>

<p>With assurances of fidelity to the Saddozai
family and friendship to the British Government&mdash;and
stipulation that all supplies and carriage
obtained from the Khan must be paid for
"without hesitation"&mdash;the treaty was duly concluded
on March 28th, 1839.</p>

<p>Everything seemed satisfactory and the Khan
promised to visit Quetta to pay his salaams to
Shah Shujia. Sir Alexander Burnes, who had
preceded him, was robbed on the way of the draft
of the treaty signed by the Khan. Treacherous
Mulla Mahommed Hasan did not fail to impress
upon the British that the Khan had given
directions to have the treaty stolen, and had,
furthermore, prevented Mehrab from proceeding
to Quetta. The hostility of the Khan being
evident, it was resolved to send a punitive expedition
to Kelat to give the Khan a lesson.</p>

<p>On the 13th of November, 1839, the town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-386" id="Pg_2-386"></a>[<a href="./images/2-386.png">386</a>]</span>
was stormed and taken by a detachment of
General Wiltshire's brigade, Mehrab Khan was
killed and his son fled, while the Khan's Minister
was made prisoner and his treachery proved.</p>

<p>Shah Nawaz Khan&mdash;a youth of fourteen, a
direct descendant in the male line from Mahabat
Khan&mdash;was set up by the British as the future
Khan of Kelat. The provinces of Sarawan and
Kach Gandava were annexed to the dominions
of the Amir of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Mehrab's son, Nasir Khan, the rightful successor
to the rule of Kelat, headed a revolution;
Shah Nawaz was deposed, the British representative
at Kelat was killed, and Nasir Khan was
eventually established in power by the British,
the two provinces restored to him, and a new
treaty concluded with him on October 6th,
1841.</p>

<p>This treaty acknowledged Nasir Khan and his
descendants the vassals of the King of Cabul;
allowed if necessary, the Honourable Company's
or Shah Shujia's troops to be stationed in any
positions they deemed advisable in any part
of his territory; and declared that a British
resident officer's advice should always be followed.
Caravans into Afghanistan from the Indus as well
as from Soumiani port were to be protected from
attacks, and no undue exactions imposed on
them; the British Government undertook to
afford Nasir Khan protection in case of attack;
while Nasir Khan bound himself to provide for
the support of Shah Nawaz whom he had
deposed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-387" id="Pg_2-387"></a>[<a href="./images/2-387.png">387</a>]</span></p>

<p>This treaty became useless after the retirement
from Cabul, and it was found necessary to
negotiate a new agreement dated 4th of May,
1854, which annulled the treaty of October 6th,
1841, enjoined perpetual friendship between the
British Government and the Khan of Kelat, his
heirs and successors, and bound Nasir Khan and
successive Khans "to oppose to their utmost
all enemies of the British Government with
whom he must act in subordinate co-operation,
and not enter, without consent, into negotiations
with foreign States."</p>

<p>British troops might occupy, if necessary, any
position they thought advisable in the Kelat
territory, and British subjects and merchants from
Sindh or the coast to Afghanistan were to be
protected against outrage, plunder and exactions.
A transit duty, however, was to be imposed at
the rate of six rupees on each camel-load from
the coast to the northern frontier, and 5 rupees
from Shikarpur to the same frontier.</p>

<p>To aid Nasir Khan, his heirs and successors,
in the fulfilment of these obligations, and on condition
of faithful performance of them, the
British Government bound itself to pay to Mir
Nasir Khan, his heirs and successors, an annual
subsidy of 50,000 Company's rupees. If, however,
the conditions required were not fulfilled
year by year the Government would stop the
payment of the annual subsidy.</p>

<p>When Nasir Khan died in 1857, his brother,
his son, and his half-brother claimed the succession,
and the latter, Khudadad Khan, a boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-388" id="Pg_2-388"></a>[<a href="./images/2-388.png">388</a>]</span>
of ten, was elected by the chiefs; but had it not
been for the support given him by the British
Government, who for four successive years paid
him an additional 50,000 rupees besides the
50,000 stipulated in the agreement, in order to
help him to suppress the rebellious Marris tribe,
he could not have maintained his position.</p>

<p>The leading Kelat chiefs, dissatisfied with their
ruler, elected Sherdil Khan, Khudadad's cousin,
as Khan of Kelat, but he was murdered the
following year, 1864, and the banished ruler
reinstated in his former position. Previous to
his banishment, in 1862, a proper agreement was
signed defining the boundary line between British
India and the Khan's territory, but it was not
till 1887 that matters regarding it were absolutely
settled.</p>

<p>One thing may be said for the Beluch, and
that is that, barring a few squabbles, they have
in the main been friendly and faithful towards
the British.</p>

<p>On February 20th and March 23rd, 1863, a
convention was entered into with the Khan
containing an additional clause for the extension
of a telegraph line through such of his dominions
as lie between the western boundary of
the province of Mekran under the feudatory
rule of the Jam of Beyla and the eastern
boundary of the territory of Gwadur, for the
protection (only) of which line, and those employed
upon it, the Khan was to receive an
annual payment of 5,000 rupees, the whole sum
to be expended among the chiefs and people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-389" id="Pg_2-389"></a>[<a href="./images/2-389.png">389</a>]</span>
through whose country the line passed. It was
particularly stipulated that the sites on which
British Government buildings were to be erected
should remain the property of the Khan.</p>

<p>Constant risings took place during the rule of
Khudadad, and the Brahui chiefs combined in
an open rebellion in 1871. The Khan, being
unable to suppress the rising, demanded aid of
the British. A mediation took place in Jacobabad,
their confiscated lands were restored to the
Sardars, the allowances which they customarily
received in the time of Mir Nasir Khan the
younger were again granted, and the Sardars
on their side had to return all the property
plundered.</p>

<p>A state of chaos followed this arrangement,
the Khan ceased to take an interest in the
administration of his country, caravans were
constantly attacked and robbed, raids were frequent,
and no compensation was ever paid for
losses sustained. The Political Agent had to
withdraw from Kelat, and in 1854 the payment
of the subsidy was withheld until the Khan
should stand by his agreement and restore order.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to keep quiet the
Marris and Bugtis frontier tribes by additional
payments to the chiefs in the name of the Khan,
but their attitude was uncertain. Constant
attacks occurred on the frontier and a state or
absolute anarchy reigned in the Khan's country,
when Captain Sandeman was despatched in 1875
as a special Agent for the Government to attempt
to bring about a reconciliation between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-390" id="Pg_2-390"></a>[<a href="./images/2-390.png">390</a>]</span>
the Khan and the Sardars. At a Darbar held
at Mastung in July, 1876, an official reconciliation
actually took place between the Khan and
the leading Brahui chiefs. On the 8th of December
of that same year the Khan was received
by the Viceroy of India at Jacobabad, and a new
treaty was concluded, which was the actual
foundation of the Beluchistan Agency.</p>

<p>The new treaty renewed and reaffirmed the
treaty of 1854, and while the Khan of Kelat
and his successors and Sardars bound themselves
faithfully to observe the provisions of Article 3
of that treaty, viz., "to oppose all enemies of
the British Government, and in all cases to act
in subordinate co-operation with the British
Government; the British Government on its
part engaged to respect the independence of
Kelat and to aid the Khan, in case of need, in
the maintenance of a just authority and the protection
of his territories from external attacks."</p>

<p>British Agents with suitable escorts were in
future to reside permanently at the Court of the
Khan and elsewhere in the Khan's dominions,
and a representative of the Khan would in future
be accredited to the Government of India.</p>

<p>The British Agent at the Court of the Khan
would, in case of dispute with the Sardars, use
his influence to bring about an amicable settlement,
and if unsuccessful, the dispute was to be
submitted to arbitration. At the request of the
Khan and of the Sardars, and "in recognition of
the intimate relations existing between the two
countries, the British Government (by Article 6<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-391" id="Pg_2-391"></a>[<a href="./images/2-391.png">391</a>]</span>
of Treaty) assented to the request of H.H. the
Khan for the presence of a detachment of British
troops in his country, on condition that the
troops should be stationed in such positions as
the British Government might deem expedient
and be withdrawn at the pleasure of the Government."</p>

<p>The agreement further provided for the construction
of railways and telegraphs through the
territories of the Khan, and for free trade
between the State of Kelat and British territory,
subject to certain conditions for the mutual protection
of fiscal interests.</p>

<p>The annual subsidy of the Khan's successor
was increased by this treaty to 100,000 rupees,
plus 20,500 rupees annually for the establishment
of posts and development of traffic along
the trade routes in a manner agreeable to the
British Government.</p>

<p>In compliance with the agreement, British
troops were stationed at Shalkot (Quetta) and
Mittri, and on February 21st, 1877, Major
Sandeman was appointed Agent to the Governor-General,
with three assistants, the headquarters
to be in Quetta. Afterwards the territories,
under the political control of the Agent, were
subdivided into distinct Agencies of which Kelat
was one. During the Afghan war the Khan
behaved most loyally towards the British.</p>

<p>Further developments necessitated a fresh
agreement signed on June 8th, 1883, by which
the Khan of Kelat made over the entire management
of the Quetta district and Niabat absolutely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-392" id="Pg_2-392"></a>[<a href="./images/2-392.png">392</a>]</span>
and with all the rights and privileges, as well as
full revenue, civil and criminal jurisdiction, and
all other powers of administration, to the British
Government, the agreement to take effect from
April 1st, 1883, on condition that, in lieu of the
annual surplus of revenue hitherto paid to the
Khan, the British <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Goverment'">Government</ins> should from
March 31st, 1884, pay a fixed annual rent of
Rs.25,000, without deductions for cost of administration.</p>

<p>The Khan transferred all his rights to levy
dues or tolls on the trade in either direction
through the Bolan Pass, as well as from Kachi to
Khorassan, and to and from British India and the
districts of Sibi, Quetta and Pishin.</p>

<p>For the latter concession the British Government
paid the Khan the annual sum of Rs.30,000
net, plus a fixed yearly sum to be paid by the
Viceroy of India to the Sarawan and Kurd Sardars
for their services in the Pass. The full civil,
criminal jurisdiction, and all other powers of administration
within the limits of the said Pass,
and within the land purchased by the British,
were also ceded to the British Government.</p>

<p>The population of the State of Kelat, including
Kharan and Makran, was estimated by
Aitchison at about 220,500 souls&mdash;the area at
106,000 square miles.</p>

<p>The Chiefship of Kharan lies along the northern
border of the State of Kelat, roughly from near
Nushki, west-south-west to Panjur. The principal
tribes are the Naushirwanis, and their Chiefs
have at various epochs acknowledged the suze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-393" id="Pg_2-393"></a>[<a href="./images/2-393.png">393</a>]</span>rainty
of the Khan of Kelat, and the rulers of
Persia and Afghanistan respectively. In 1884
Sardar Azad Khan acknowledged allegiance to
the Khan of Kelat, and in 1885 a settlement was
made with him by which he undertook to do
certain tribal services in consideration of an
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'annul'">annual</ins> payment of Rs.6,000. Besides Kharan
the Sardar holds lands in Panjgur, and lays claim
to Jalk, Dizak, and Kohak, the two first being
within the Persian boundary.</p>

<p>We have other important agreements, such as
the one (1861) with the Chief of Las Bela for
the protection of the telegraph, for which he
receives a subsidy of Rs.8,400 a year; and a
number of agreements with the various chiefs of
Makran, mostly relating also to the protection of
the telegraph line with subsidies or allowances to
each chief.</p>

<p>To the troublesome Marris, a tribe occupying
the country from the Nari river and the outskirts
of the Bolan as far as the plain of Sham near the
Punjab boundary to the east, allowances are paid
directly for tribal services and for good behaviour.
These people have given considerable
trouble on several occasions, but are now friendly.</p>

<p>A petroleum concession was ceded by Sardar
Mehrulla Khan to the British Government for
an annual cash payment.</p>

<p>The affairs of British Beluchistan (Pishin, Sibi
and dependencies) are too well known for me to
refer to them again beyond what I have already
mentioned in these pages. Till 1878 British
Beluchistan formed part of the territories of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-394" id="Pg_2-394"></a>[<a href="./images/2-394.png">394</a>]</span>
Afghanistan, and was occupied by British troops
during the Afghan war. By the treaty of Gandamak
its administration was put into the hands
of British officers, but the surplus revenue was
paid to the Amir at Cabul. The control of the
Khyber and Michui Passes was also retained. In
1887, however, the district was incorporated
with British India, and is now known as the
province of British Beluchistan.</p>

<p class="illc">Beluch Huts thatched with Palm Leaves and Tamarisk.</p>

<p>An agreement of submission and allegiance
was made by the Maliks of Zhob, Bori and the
Muza Khal, and Sardar Shahbaz Khan, on
November 22nd, 1884, and they further undertook
to pay a fine of Rs.22,000, to put a stop to
further raiding in British territory, and raise no
opposition to British troops being stationed in
Zhob and Bori. The occupation of Zhob took
place in 1889-90, when the Somal Pass was
opened up, and the tribes intervening between
the Zhob and the Punjab in the Suliman range
were subsequently added to the district.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> given a general sketch of the agreements
with the principal chiefs we will now return to
matters relating to the most important point, the
pivot, as it were, of our route&mdash;Nushki.</p>

<p>When Nushki was taken over by the British
Government, the leading tribe in the district
was the Zagar Mengal, a Brahui tribe. They
had settled in Nushki approximately a century or
150 years ago, and were a most powerful tribe, supposed
to number about 9,000, a large proportion
of whom lived in Registan (country of sand),
to the north and mostly north-east of Nushki
across the Afghan frontier. The Zagar Mengal
Sardar was in Nushki itself, and he had a right of
levying what is termed in Beluch, <i>Sunge</i> (a transit
due) on all merchandise passing through Nushki.
Foreseeing how such a right would interfere with
trade, the British Government came to terms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-396" id="Pg_2-396"></a>[<a href="./images/2-396.png">396</a>]</span>
with the Sardar, by which, instead of his transit
dues, he undertook what is called in Beluchistan
a <i>noukri</i> or service (old custom by which a man
supplies a number of <i>sawars</i> and is responsible
for them).</p>

<p>The next thing was to settle all the tribal feuds.
Three or four tribes were at war. Cases were
carefully inquired into and settled according to
Beluch law, through the medium of a tribal
<i>jirga</i>, a council of elders. One case led to
another and eventually all were settled up to
everybody's satisfaction.</p>

<p>In the meantime traders from Shikarpur,
from Quetta, and Kelat, began to be attracted
to Nushki; a bazaar was started and is fast growing
from year to year. One hundred thousand
rupees have already been spent on it, with the
result that a number of competing traders came
in. Competition resulted in good prices, which
further attracted trade, first from the districts to
the north in the immediate vicinity of Nushki,
and later from further and further afield.</p>

<p>The name of Nushki&mdash;practically unknown a
few years ago&mdash;is at present well known everywhere,
and the place has, indeed, become quite
an important trade centre. From Nushki, as we
have seen, a chain of posts, manned by local
Beluch levies, was pushed west as far as Robat on
the Persian frontier. Even as late as 1897 trade
in these parts was limited to a few articles of
local consumption, and Persian trade was represented
by a stray caravan from Sistan that had
forced its way to Nushki and frequently lost men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-397" id="Pg_2-397"></a>[<a href="./images/2-397.png">397</a>]</span>
camels and goods on the way. The venturesome
caravans seldom numbered more than one or two
a year, and were at the mercy of a Mamasani
Beluch called Pasand Khan, who lived in Sistan
and levied blackmail on such caravans as came
through. This man was well acquainted with
all the marauders who haunted the stretch
of country south of the Halmund between
Sistan and Chagai. Pasand Khan levied
at the rate of twenty krans (about 8s. 4d.)
per camel, and saw the caravans in comparative
safety as far as Chagai, from which point they
were left to their own devices and had to force
their way through to Quetta as best they could.</p>

<p>Next to Nushki along the route, Dalbandin&mdash;owing
to its geographical situation, its ample
supply of good water and good grazing&mdash;is
probably the most important spot, and may
one day become quite a big place. There is
direct communication from this spot to Chagai
(and Afghanistan), Robat, Ladis, Bampur, Kharan,
the Arabian Sea, Charbar, Gwadur, Ormarah,
Soumiani and Quetta. Even as things are now,
Dalbandin is a somewhat more important place
than any we had met on coming from Robat,
with a very large <i>thana</i> and a couple of well-provided
shops. Captain Webb-Ware's large
camp made it appear to us men of the desert
quite a populous district. There was excellent
water here and good grazing for camels, while
on the hills close by ibex shooting was said to be
good. Gazelles (<i>Chinkara</i> and Persian gazelle),
both called <i>ask</i> in Beluch, are to be found in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-398" id="Pg_2-398"></a>[<a href="./images/2-398.png">398</a>]</span>
neighbourhood of this place, and wild asses
(<i>ghorkhar</i>) nearer Sahib Chah. <i>Katunga</i> (sand
grouse), <i>sisi</i>, <i>chickor</i>, a few small bustards
(<i>habara</i>), and occasionally ducks are to be seen
near the water, but taking things all round there
is little on the road to repay the sportsman who
is merely in search of game.</p>

<p>The spacious rest-house at Dalbandin was
quite palatial, with actual panes of glass in all
the windows, mats on the floor, folding chairs
to sit upon, tables and Indian bedsteads. Thanks
to the kind hospitality of Captain Webb-Ware,
I had a most pleasant and instructive day's rest
here, and nearly made myself sick by greedily
eating irresistible Beluch dates, the most delicious
it has ever been my luck to taste. These dates
are very carefully prepared in earthen jars with
honey, and they say that only one date&mdash;the
best&mdash;is picked from each tree. No description
could ever come up to their delicate flavour.</p>

<p>There is a famous Ziarat a couple of miles
from Dalbandin which well repays a visit. The
larger Ziarat itself is circular, 25 feet in
diameter, with a mud and stone wall 4 feet high
round it. It has a door to the east and a tomb
to the west. A bundle of sticks is laid outside
the wall, and another much larger, with red and
white rags upon it, at the head of the tomb, the
latter being covered as usual with pieces of white
marble and round stones. At the head of the
grave near the upright sticks was a large stone
with holes in the centre, and also a number of
wooden drinking cups, masses of horns, sticks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-399" id="Pg_2-399"></a>[<a href="./images/2-399.png">399</a>]</span>
whips, ends of broken bottles, bits of rope, etc.
These fragments of civilization hardly added to
its picturesqueness. The tomb lay from north
to south&mdash;a very curious fact, for, as a rule, the
head of the tomb in other Ziarats was to the
west. The tomb, however, lay in the western
portion of the Ziarat circle. The enclosing
wall was adorned with horns of sacrificed goats,
and, in fact, outside to the south was the
sacrificial spot with some large slabs of stone
smeared with blood, and the usual upright
sticks, but no rags appended to them. It had,
nevertheless, some decoration of horns.</p>

<p>A second Ziarat was to be found on the top
of the hill&mdash;generally these Ziarats go in couples,
the principal one on the summit of a hill, the
other at the foot, the latter for the convenience
of travellers who have not the time or the
energy to climb to the higher sacred spot,&mdash;and
this Ziarat was 45 feet long also with a tomb&mdash;this
time of black rounded stones&mdash;with an
upright white slab of marble. The wall of
black stones was 1&frac12; feet high. Below this,
to the south, was a third smaller oval Ziarat,
20 feet long, 12 feet wide, with many offerings
of horns perched on poles to the west, and
a heap of fancy stones, together with some
implements such as a mortar, pestle, and cups.
A fourth Ziarat, very small, with a mud tomb
on which two mill stones had been deposited,
was a little further on and had a solitary rag
flying.</p>

<p>Near these Ziarats was an extensive Beluch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-400" id="Pg_2-400"></a>[<a href="./images/2-400.png">400</a>]</span>
burial-ground, to which bodies were brought
from very great distances for interment. There
was a large rectangular Mesjid, the first I had
seen of that shape, at the western point of the
graveyard, and three smaller ones at the other
corners, and the graves were very nice and tidy,
formed generally of fragments of yellow marble,
a high stone pillar at the head and one at the
foot, and little chips of marble along the upper
centre of the grave. Others more elaborate had
a neat edge and centre line of black stones and
coloured end pillars, while some consisted of a
pile of horizontal sticks with an upright one at
each end.</p>

<p>The bodies of more important people, such as
chiefs, were given larger tombs, often very gaudy
and of a prismatic shape, made of myriads of
bits of crystal within a black border of stones.
Occasionally a trench was dug round the graves.</p>

<p>It was interesting to note that here, too, as on
the Kuh-i-Kwajah, one saw "family graves"
which, although not in actual compartments like
those on the Sistan mountain, were, nevertheless,
secluded from the others within a low boundary
stone wall. The prismatic graves seldom rose
more than 1&frac12; feet above ground, but the semi-spherical
tumuli which marked some of the
more important burial places were from 3&frac12; to
4 feet high. These tumuli were either of mud
or of large smooth pebbles, and generally had no
pillars. One or two, however, had a pillar to
the west.</p>

<p>To the east of the graveyard the graves which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-401" id="Pg_2-401"></a>[<a href="./images/2-401.png">401</a>]</span>
seemed of a more recent date had sticks at each
end instead of stone pillars, and these were connected
by a string to which, halfway between
the sticks, hung a piece of wood, a ribbon, or a
rag. The meaning of this I could not well
ascertain, and the versions I heard were many
and conflicting. Some said these were graves of
people who had been recently buried, it being
customary to erect the stone pillars some months
after burial, and that the string with dangling
rag or piece of wood was merely to keep wolves
from digging up dead bodies. Others said it
was to keep evil spirits away, but each man gave
a different explanation, and I really could not say
which was the true origin of the custom. The
pillars over a man's grave, some say, signify that
the man died without leaving issue, but I think
this is incorrect, for it would then appear by
most graves that the Beluch are the most unprolific
people on earth, which I believe is not
the case.</p>

<p>Children's graves were usually covered with
pieces of white marble or light coloured stone,
and those of women were generally smaller and
less elaborate and with lower pillars than men's
graves.</p>

<p>The preparing of corpses for interment is
rather interesting. With men, the lower jaw is
set so that the mouth is closed tight, and is kept
in this position by the man's own turban which
is wound round the chin and over the head.
The eyes are also gently closed by some relative,
and the hands placed straight by the sides. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-402" id="Pg_2-402"></a>[<a href="./images/2-402.png">402</a>]</span>
soon as life is pronounced extinct the body is
covered over with a sheet and the dead man's
relations go and procure new clothes, after which
the body is removed from the tent or house and
is taken towards a well or a stream, according to
circumstances. Here the body is laid down and
carefully washed, after which it is wrapped up
quite tight in sheets&mdash;so tight that the outline
can plainly be distinguished. In most cases, a
pillar is put up, a few stones laid round, or the
outline of a grave drawn on the spot where the
body has lain to undergo this operation. The
body is then removed to the burial ground and
laid most reverently in the grave.</p>

<p class="illc">Beluch Mesjid and Graveyard at Dalbandin.</p>

<p>Beluch graves are most peculiarly cut into the
ground. Instead of being vertical, like ours, they
are in three sections. The higher is vertical,
and leads to an inclined side channel giving
access to a lower last chamber, in which the
body is actually deposited. The origin of this, I
was told, is to prevent hyenas and wolves digging
up the bodies.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-100.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-100_th.jpg" alt="Section of Beluch Grave." title="Section of Beluch Grave." /></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-403" id="Pg_2-403"></a>[<a href="./images/2-403.png">403</a>]</span></p>
<p>When once the body is laid in its place of rest,
dried sweet-scented rose leaves are spread over it
in profusion, and then the grave is filled up with
stones and plastered with mud. The channel
between the two chambers is filled entirely
with stones, and the upper chamber entirely
with earth.</p>

<p>Some few of the graves I saw had fallen
through, but most were in excellent preservation
and appeared to be well looked after by the
people. That the Beluch are provident people
we had palpable proof in this cemetery, where
one saw several graves ready for likely future
occupants.</p>

<p>Another Mesjid, a circular one seven feet in
diameter, was further to be noticed to the north-east
of the graveyard. It had yellow marble
pillars of sugar-loaf and cylindrical shapes and
was enclosed by a neat stone wall.</p>

<p>A Beluch marriage is a practical business
transaction by which a girl fetches more or less
money, camels or horses, according to her
personal charms, beauty, and social position.
Beluch women, when young, are not at all bad-looking
with well-cut features and languid eyes
full of animal magnetism like the Persian, and
they seem shy and modest enough. The Beluch
men have great respect for them, and treat them
with consideration, although&mdash;like all Orientals&mdash;they
let women do all the hard work, which
keeps the women happy.</p>

<p>A marriage ceremony in Beluchistan bears, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-404" id="Pg_2-404"></a>[<a href="./images/2-404.png">404</a>]</span>
course, much resemblance to the usual Mussulman
form, such as we have seen in Persia, with
variations and adaptations to suit the customs
and circumstances of the people.</p>

<p>A good wife costs a lot of money in Beluchistan,
although occasionally, in such cases as when
a man has been murdered, a wife can be obtained
on the cheap. The murderer, instead of paying
a lump sum in cash, settles his account by
handing over his daughter as a wife to the
murdered man's son. Bad debts and no assets
can also be settled in a similar manner if the
debtor has sufficient daughters to make the
balance right.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, however, the
girl is actually bought up, the sum becoming her
property in case of divorce. When the marriage
ceremony takes place and the relations and friends
have collected, the first step is for the bridegroom
to hand over the purchase sum, either in cash,
camels, or sheep. A great meal is then prepared,
when the men sit in a semicircle with
the bridegroom in the centre. Enormous
quantities of food are consumed, such as rice
saturated with <i>ghi</i> (butter), piles of <i>chapatis</i>
(bread) and sheep meat. A man who pays four
or five hundred rupees for a wife is expected to
kill at least twenty or thirty sheep for his guests
at this entertainment, and there is a prevailing
custom that the bridegroom on this occasion
makes a gift to the <i>lori</i> or blacksmith of the
clothes he has been wearing since his betrothal
to the girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-405" id="Pg_2-405"></a>[<a href="./images/2-405.png">405</a>]</span></p>

<p>The women on their side have a similar sort
of entertainment by themselves, stuff themselves
with food to their hearts' content, and wash it
down with water or tea. At the end of the
meal a bowl is passed round and each man and
woman rinses mouth and hands.</p>

<p>The <i>Sung</i>, or betrothal, is regarded as most
sacred, and much rejoicing is gone through for
several days with music and dancing and firing of
guns, and this is called the <i>nikkar</i>, just preceding
the <i>urus</i>, or actual marriage ceremony, which is
performed by a Mullah. The bridegroom, having
ridden with his friends to a neighbouring Ziarat
to implore Allah's protection, returns and sits
down in the centre of the circle formed by the
men. Two of his friends are sent to fetch the
girl's father, who is led down to the assembly.</p>

<p>The bridegroom again assures him in front of
all these witnesses that should he from any fault
of his own divorce his wife he will forfeit the
premium paid for her, whereupon the father
replies that he will settle a sum on the girl as a
"<i>mehr</i>" or dowry. The father then departs,
and returns, bringing the bride wrapped up in
her best clothing and <i>chudder</i>.</p>

<p>A slightly modified Mussulman form of marriage
is then gone through, and the Mullah asks
the woman three times if she agrees to marry the
man. Everything having passed off satisfactorily,
the happy couple depart to a hut or tent placed
at their disposal, and very discreetly, nobody
goes near them for some considerable length
of time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-406" id="Pg_2-406"></a>[<a href="./images/2-406.png">406</a>]</span></p>

<p>It is said that the thoughtfulness of the Beluch
towards a newly-married couple will go so far
that, even if the tribe were stalked by the enemy,
no one would go and warn the happy couple for
fear of disturbing them!</p>

<p>The bridegroom stays with his bride for several
days, and if he belongs to some other village or
encampment, will then return to his home, and
leave his wife behind for months at a time.</p>

<p>Beluch wives are said to be quite faithful, and
at the death of the husband go for a considerable
time without washing. This mark of respect
for the husband is, however, extensively indulged
in even before the wife becomes a widow&mdash;at
least, judging by appearances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Webb-Ware</span> having most kindly
arranged to "dak" camels for me, I was enabled
to remain here one day by sending my own
camels with loads ahead, I proposing to catch
them up by going three marches on January 27th.
The distance was 54 miles 980 yards, and I
covered it in nine hours, which was quite good
going.</p>

<p>"Sand mounts and high hill ranges were to
the north and south, and the track lay east-north-east
(70&deg; b.m.) with parallel sand ridges to the
north. Three long sand banks from 30 to 50 feet
high, facing north, accumulated by wind coming
through gaps in the hills. To south, high
mountains as one approaches Karodak."</p>

<p>That is the only entry I find in my note-book
for the march between Dalbandin and Karodak
(16 miles 380 yards). Here the camel that had
been sent ahead for me to ride to the next post-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-408" id="Pg_2-408"></a>[<a href="./images/2-408.png">408</a>]</span>house
had unluckily bolted, and after wasting
nearly an hour the Beluch were unable to capture
him. I bade good-bye to the <i>jemadar</i>
and his men, who had politely escorted me
thus far, and had to continue upon the same
camel.</p>

<p>At Karodak (3,220 feet) there was a small
<i>thana</i> surrounded by sand hills, with high tamarisks
and good grazing for camels, but the water
of the wells was salt.</p>

<p>We trotted along in a terrific wind storm,
with yellowish dust obscuring everything like
a fog, and went over numerous big stretches
of mud and salt, cracked by the sun in semicircles
like the scales of a fish. Low hills could
now be perceived to north, south and east, when
the wind slightly abated and the dust settled
down.</p>

<p>After crossing a sand ridge extending from
north to south, we still going east-north-east
(70&deg; b.m.), another large salt plain disclosed itself
before us. The old track went from this point
towards the south, but the new one was in a
perfectly straight line. For the first time since
entering Beluchistan one began to see some
little vegetation on the hill sides, and a few
high tamarisks could be noticed in the plain
itself.</p>

<p>At Yadgar (altitude 3,100 feet) we found a
four-towered <i>thana</i>, with one <i>duffadar</i>, four
sepoys, five <i>mari</i> camels, and three wells of good
water, as well as a new bungalow, but I only
remained just a few minutes to change my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-409" id="Pg_2-409"></a>[<a href="./images/2-409.png">409</a>]</span>
belongings from Captain Webb-Ware's camel to
mine, which was waiting here for me, and
speedily proceeded for Padag where, in a terrible
wind which had risen again after sunset, I arrived
at eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>At Padag (3,080 feet) a number of semi-spherical
Beluch huts, 4 to 5 feet high, with
domes thatched with tamarisk and palm leaves,
were to be seen. Most dwellings were in
couples, enclosed in a circular wall for protection
against the wind as well as from the
observation of intruders. Although a cold wind
was blowing fiercely at the time, and the thermometer
was only four degrees above freezing
point, there were some twenty children playing
about perfectly naked, and they seemed quite
happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>From Padag we went across another plain of
salt and mud, with <i>sorag</i> grass and <i>drog</i>, two
plants much cherished by camels. To the north
of our track was an extensive surface of salt
deposits, extending from west to east, which
looked just as if the country were covered by
snow. Quantities of <i>eshwerk</i>&mdash;very pretty to
look at when in flower, but most poisonous&mdash;were
now found, and <i>brug</i>, good for horses.
There were three parallel ranges of broken-up
mountains on our south, and lots of tamarisks on
the south edge of the salt deposits. It was rather
curious that to the north of our track the vegetation
consisted entirely of <i>drog</i> grass, whereas to
the south there was only <i>eshwerk</i>.</p>

<p>A few yards from the track to the south we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-410" id="Pg_2-410"></a>[<a href="./images/2-410.png">410</a>]</span>
came upon a graveyard (a Kabistan) with some
fifteen or twenty graves. Water we had seen
flowing in two or three channels from the mountain
to supply villages and forming pools here and
there. We passed between two mountains into
another plain with dried up <i>karankosh</i> bushes,
much liked by camels. Good grazing for horses
was to be found north, and extended as far as
the foot of the mountains.</p>

<p class="illc">Old Beluch Mud Fort near Nushki.</p>

<p>Kuchaki Chah, an unroofed rest-house a few
feet square&mdash;a photograph of which can be seen
in the illustration here appended&mdash;lies between
two high ranges of rocky mountains with high
accumulations of sand to the south-west and
north-east respectively. The rugged mountains
to the south were called Bajin. Another shrub,
<i>trat</i>, also much cherished by camels, was plentiful
here. Black precipitous rocks in vertical strata,
splitting into long slabs and blocks, were to be seen
along the mountain range to the South.</p>

<p>We had made another double march on that
day, and reached Mall in the middle of the night.
Padag to Kuchaki Chah, 13 miles, 756 yards;
Kuchaki Chah to Mall, 15 miles, 1,154 yards.
Total, 29 miles, 150 yards.</p>

<p>It was freezing hard, thermometer 28&deg; Fahrenheit,
and the wind bitterly cold. My men felt it
very much and so did my camels, which all
became ill.</p>

<p>We left Mall again very early the following
morning, as I intended to proceed direct to
Nushki. There were two tracks here to
Nushki, the old and the new. The old track<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-411" id="Pg_2-411"></a>[<a href="./images/2-411.png">411</a>]</span>
went in a straight line and was in consequence
some miles shorter; the new track more or less
follows the foot of the mountain range, probably
taking this course for the convenience of the
several Beluch villages to be found in the Nushki
plain.</p>

<p>The rocky mountain range to the south got
lower as we approached Nushki, and was then
crossed by another low range extending from
north to south while the longer and higher range
stretched from north-north-east to south-south-west.
A few miles from Nushki we
came across some most peculiar and very
deep cracks in the earth's crust. One could
plainly see that they were not caused by the
erosion of water, but by a commotion such
as an earthquake. In fact, we came, soon after, to
a place where the whole sandy plateau had
actually collapsed, and when we stood on the
edge of the portion which still remained
unchanged, we could see it end abruptly in
perpendicular cliffs. What was the evident
continuation of the valley lay now some hundred
or more feet below its former level. In this
lower valley there were a number of Beluch
villages.</p>

<p>This crack and depression extends for no less
than 120 miles, according to Major MacMahon,
who in 1896 went, I believe, along its entire
length into Afghan territory, and he describes it
as "a well-defined, broad line of deep indentations,
in places as clearly defined as a deep railway cutting.
Springs of water are to be found along its course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-412" id="Pg_2-412"></a>[<a href="./images/2-412.png">412</a>]</span>
The crack extends north from Nushki along the
foot of the Sarlat range, and then diagonally
across the Khwajah Amran range, cutting the
crest of the main range near its highest peak
and crossing the Lora River. A well-marked
indentation was traceable at the edge of the plain
near Murghachaman, some 18 miles north of
Chaman."</p>

<p>MacMahon states that the Beluch themselves
attribute it to three different earthquakes, of
which accounts have been handed down by their
fathers, and at the time of which deep fissures
appeared that have subsequently extended.
Major MacMahon adds that this crack marks
the line of a gigantic geological fault, with
sedimentary rocks to the east of it and igneous
rocks to the west, and he believes, rightly, I
think, that the length of this fault line exceeds
that of any other fault line yet discovered.</p>

<p>On the upper plateau on which we travelled
tamarisks altogether disappeared for the last
twenty miles or so, and <i>tagaz</i> shrubs, varying
from one to six feet high, were practically the
only plant we saw. In the underlying plain
tamarisk was most plentiful. Facing us on the
mountain side a white cliff could be seen from a
a long distance, with a most regular row of
double black marks which looked exactly like
windows.</p>

<p>On approaching Nushki we saw some patches
of cultivation (wheat)&mdash;quite a novelty to us, being
the first crops of any extent we had seen since
leaving Sistan&mdash;and near at hand an old Beluch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-413" id="Pg_2-413"></a>[<a href="./images/2-413.png">413</a>]</span>
fort, of which a photograph is given in the
illustration. The fort possessed a picturesque
composite old tower, partly quadrangular, partly
cylindrical.</p>

<p>We reached Nushki at night (31 miles, 1,320
yards from Mall).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> arriving at this new city, with actual
streets and people moving about in them, shops,
etc., it seemed to me at first almost as good as if
I had arrived back in London again. The
Bungalow, on a prominent hill 75 feet above the
plain, was simply and nicely furnished, and was
most comfortable in every way. From it one
obtained a fine panoramic view of the small town
and the neighbouring country with the many
Beluch villages scattered about.</p>

<p>North, two miles off, was Mengal, a village of
about 300 houses and 1,500 people; west lay
Jumaldini (2&frac12; miles distant), 200 houses, 6-700
inhabitants; north-west, Badini in two blocks,
one belonging to Alun Khan, the other jointly to
Khaian Khan and Adal Khan: 200 houses
collectively, 400 to 500 people. Little Badal
Khan Karez, with only 30 houses, stood to the
south-west. The population of these villages is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-415" id="Pg_2-415"></a>[<a href="./images/2-415.png">415</a>]</span>
formed of the tribes called <i>Barechis</i> and <i>Rashkhanis</i>,
the people of Badini and Jumaldini being
entirely Rashkhanis. The Barechis formerly
inhabited Afghanistan, but migrated to the
Nushki district three generations ago. Bagag
(south-west) is a village generally inhabited by
Mandais, a branch of the Jumaldini Rashkhanis.</p>

<p>Two big villages are to be found south, and
they are called <i>Batto</i>, which means "mixture,"
owing to the populations being composed of
Rashkhanis, Mingals, Samalaris, Kharanis, and
other minor tribes; and south of Batto are two
more villages (east and west respectively of each
other). The one east is Harunis, a separate tribe
from either the Rashkhanis and the Mingals,
who follow the head chief Rind. The second
village (west) is Ahmed Val, inhabited by Ahmed
Zai Mingals. Besides these villages, the remainder
of the population is of nomads.</p>

<p>It may have been noticed that regarding the
village of Bagag I said that "generally" it was
inhabited by Mandais. Certain villages are
inhabited by certain tribes during the summer,
the people migrating for the winter months, and
other tribes come in for the winter and vacate
their quarters in the summer. The Beluch is
not much burdened with furniture and can do
this without inconvenience.</p>

<p>The crops grown consist of wheat, barley and
<i>jowari</i> (millet). Where good grazing is obtainable
the younger folks are sent out with sheep,
horses and camels.</p>

<p>Almost each tribe has a different style of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-416" id="Pg_2-416"></a>[<a href="./images/2-416.png">416</a>]</span>
architecture for its dwellings. Those near
Nushki are usually rectangular in shape, domed
over with matting covered with plaster. The
only opening is the door, with a small porch over
it. Wooden pillars are necessary to support the
central portion of the dome (semi-cylindrical),
which is never higher than from five to eight
feet. The mangers for the horses, which form
an annexe to each dwelling&mdash;in fact, these
mangers are more prominent than the dwellings
themselves&mdash;are cylindrical mud structures eight
or nine feet high, with a hole cut into them on
one side to allow the horse's head to get at the
barley contained in the hollowed lower portion.</p>

<p class="illc">Cave Dwellers, Nushki.</p>

<p>The weaving looms are the largest and principal
articles of furniture one notices&mdash;not inside, but
outside the houses. The illustration shows how
the cloth and threads are kept in tension, from
every side, in a primitive but most effective
manner. The women work with extraordinary
rapidity and with no pattern before them, beating
each transverse thread home by means of an
iron comb held in the hand. The pattern on
the cloths is of a primitive kind, generally sets
of parallel lines crossing one another at right
angles.</p>

<p>In the same photograph two Beluch dwellings
can be seen, with matting showing through the
thatch. In many villages, however, the walls of
the houses are made of sun-dried bricks, and only
the roof is made of a mat plastered over with mud.
In either case the Beluch seems to have a liking
for crawling rather than walking into his house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-417" id="Pg_2-417"></a>[<a href="./images/2-417.png">417</a>]</span>
for the doorway is invariably very low&mdash;4&frac12; to 5
feet high.</p>

<p>One is generally sorry to peep into a Beluch
dwelling, but I felt it a sort of duty to see what
there was to be seen. Nothing! or almost
nothing. A large wooden bowl, a stone grinding
wheel with a wooden handle to grind wheat into
flour, a wooden drinking cup or an occasional tin
enamelled one, of foreign importation, a matchlock,
and that was all. In some of the smarter
dwellings, such as the houses of chiefs, a few
additional articles were to be found, such as a
<i>badni</i>&mdash;a sort of jar for taking water&mdash;flat stones
which are made red hot for baking bread, some
occasional big brass dishes&mdash;<i>tash</i>&mdash;used on grand
occasions&mdash;such as wedding dinners; and a <i>deg</i>
or two or large brass pots.</p>

<p>Nearly every household, however, possesses
one or more <i>khwa</i> or skins for water, and a large
<i>kasa</i>, made either of metal or wood, into which
broth is poured during meals. Occasionally in a
corner of the hut a small table is to be seen, on
which are placed all the family's clothing, blankets,
<i>darris</i> or carpets, and <i>lihaf</i> or mattresses. These
carpets, or rather rugs, are generally spread when
receiving an honoured guest.</p>

<p>The Beluch diet is wholesome but simple.
They are fond of plenty of meat when they can
get it, which is not often, and they generally
have to be satisfied with dry bread. The woman
who can make the largest and thinnest bread is
much honoured among the Beluch. When they
do obtain meat it is generally boiled and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-418" id="Pg_2-418"></a>[<a href="./images/2-418.png">418</a>]</span>
into a soup called <i>be-dir</i>, which in the Brahui
language really means "salt water," to express
"flavoured water." Milk and <i>ghi</i> are dainties
seldom indulged in and, being Mussulmans, the
Beluch imbibe no intoxicants, but are
smokers of strong bitter tobacco.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for lambs, sheep and
calves to share the homes and some of the meals
of their masters.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most peculiar folks at Nushki are
the cave dwellers, who live in abject misery in
holes eroded by water in the cliffs near the
river. When I visited them most were half-naked
and trembling with cold. A few rags
answered the purpose of blankets. The only
articles of furniture and comfort were a primitive
pipe moulded out of mud&mdash;the <i>chilam</i> or the
<i>gaddu</i> as it is called by the Kakars&mdash;which
occupied a prominent place in the dwelling, and
a musical instrument placed in a receptacle in the
wall of the cave. At the entrance of the cave a
wall had been built for protection against the
wind and water.</p>

<p>In another dwelling an <i>assah</i> or long iron rod,
like a crutch, the emblem of fakirs, was noticeable,
and by its side an empty "potted-tongue"
tin with a wire attached to it&mdash;an article which
was made to answer to a great many uses. This
cave had a small store place for food, a drinking
cup, and the wooden vessel&mdash;another emblem of
fakirs&mdash;in which charitable people deposit money
for the support of these poor wretches.</p>

<p>The dress of the better class Beluch men con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-419" id="Pg_2-419"></a>[<a href="./images/2-419.png">419</a>]</span>sists
of a <i>khuss</i>, or sort of loose shirt reaching
below the knees, and the enormous trousers falling
in ample folds, but fitting tight at the ankle. At
an angle on the head they wear a conical padded
cap, embroidered in gold or silver, inside a great
turban of white muslin. They also wear shawls
or long scarves thrown over the shoulders in a
fashion not unlike our Highlanders. Either shoes
with turned-up toes are worn or else sandals.
Felt coats or sheep-skins are donned in winter,
while the richer people wear handsome coats and
waistcoats of cloth embroidered in gold or silver.
The chiefs possess most beautiful and expensive
clothes.</p>

<p>The women of the poorer classes are garbed in
a short petticoat, usually red or blue, and a loose
shirt. A long cloth, not unlike a chudder, is
thrown over the head, and is kept tight round
the forehead by a band. It is fashionable to let
it drag on the ground behind. Women generally
go about barefooted. Better class ladies wear
similar clothes but of better material, and often
richly embroidered. Occasionally they put on
large trousers like Persian women. The hair is
either left to flow loose at the sides of the head,
or is tied into a knot behind.</p>

<p>Necklaces, ear-rings, nose-rings, bracelets and
armlets are worn; white shells of all sizes from
the Persian Gulf, as well as glass beads, playing
a very important part in women's ornaments.
Bracelets cut out of a large white sea-shell are
common.</p>

<p>Beluch children are rather quaint, with little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-420" id="Pg_2-420"></a>[<a href="./images/2-420.png">420</a>]</span>
skull caps, much decorated with silver coins, one
of which larger than the others hangs directly
over the forehead. The poor little mites are
further burdened with ear-rings, bracelets and
heavy necklaces of glass beads. Mothers seem
tenderly fond of their children.</p>

<p>I was much delighted on the morning of
January 29th to find that all the chiefs of the
neighbouring tribes, garbed in their gaudy robes,
had come with their retinues to pay their salaams
to me. I heard the buzzing noise of a crowd
approaching up the hill, and on looking out of
the bungalow window beheld a most picturesque
sight. A tall, long-haired figure in a brilliant
long gown of red velvet, with gold embroideries
in front and back, walked slowly a-head, followed
by a cluster of venerable old men, some in long
yellow skin <i>poshteens</i>, others in smart waistcoats
covered with gold and silver embroidery. All
wore huge turbans with gold embroidered conical
caps inside. Behind them came a mass of armed
men with swords and rifles.</p>

<p>On reaching the bungalow, fearing that I
should still be asleep, they became silent, and as
I watched them unseen from behind the blinds I
do not believe that I have ever in my life gazed
upon such a fine, dignified, manly lot of fellows
anywhere. They seated themselves in a perfect
circle, some twenty yards in diameter, directly
outside the bungalow, carpets having been spread
where the chiefs were to be accommodated.
The chiefs sat together, and the soldiers and
followers&mdash;over 150&mdash;with guns, matchlocks and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-421" id="Pg_2-421"></a>[<a href="./images/2-421.png">421</a>]</span>
Snider rifles, squatted down in two semicircles at
their sides.</p>

<p>An opening was left large enough for me to
enter the ring, and when I approached all
respectfully rose and salaamed, and the chiefs,
coming forward in turn, shook me heartily by
the hand with the usual long Beluch salutation,
each bowing low as he did so. Sitting in the
centre of the circle on a carpet, which had been
spread for me, I addressed them in a few words,
which they seemed to appreciate, and each chief
answered back in a simple, straightforward and
most thoughtful, gentlemanly manner.</p>

<p>Mahommed Ali, the leading chief, in a red
velvet coat, was the Mingal Sardar of the three
powerful tribes, Jumaldini, Badini, and Mingal,
and by his side sat Kaim Khan with his shield
and sword, the second Sardar of the neighbourhood
and brother of the Jumaldini Sardar. Jan
Beg, who sat on the left hand side of the chief
Sardar, was a thin tall man, and Alam Khan, a
splendid old fellow with a fine inlaid sword, can
be seen standing in the photograph reproduced
in the illustration.</p>

<p>The last of the principal five Badini chiefs was a
comparatively young man of black complexion,
long jet black curly hair, and garbed in a gaudy
poshteen, sword and belt. His name was Kasin
Khan.</p>

<p>Then there was Kadar Bakhsh, uncle of the
present Mingal Sardar, a man most useful to the
British Government, and beside him his brother,
Attar Khan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-422" id="Pg_2-422"></a>[<a href="./images/2-422.png">422</a>]</span></p>

<p>Gauher Khan, nephew of the Mingal Sardar,
was a picturesque young man with heavily
embroidered black coat and a black turban. He
carried his sword in his hand.</p>

<p>As one looked round the circle it was really a
most impressive and picturesque sight&mdash;colours
of all sorts dazzling in the sunlight. Among
the other most important men were Adal Khan
(cousin of the Badini chief), a very old fellow,
curved from age; and Bai Khan, his cousin, who
looked somewhat stronger; Kaiser Khan, a smart
young fellow with curly hair, black coat and
trousers, was the son of the Jumaldini chief, and
a young fellow of weak constitution, by name
Abdullah Aziz, was son and heir of the Badini
Sardar.</p>

<p class="illc">The Salaam of the Beluch Sardars at Nushki.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Sardar Alam Khan standing.)</p>

<p>Sherdil and Mehrullah Khan, with elaborately
embroidered coats and Snider rifles, sat among
the elect, and the others were soldiers and
followers, but a fine lot of fellows indeed, all the
same.</p>

<p>When the formal reception broke up I showed
them my repeating rifles, revolvers and various
instruments, which interested them greatly; and
the leading chiefs having been entertained to tea,
they eventually departed after repeated salaams.</p>

<p>Although the Beluch and the Afghan shake
hands on arrival, they seldom do so on departing,
the handshake being for them an outward sign to
express the joy of seeing a friend.</p>

<p>On surveying the neighbourhood from our
high point of vantage at the bungalow, we found
plenty to interest the observer. To the north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-423" id="Pg_2-423"></a>[<a href="./images/2-423.png">423</a>]</span>
and north-west directly below the hill could be
seen a graveyard in two sections, the tombs being
very high above ground, with prismatic tops of
white stones, whereas the bases were of black
pebbles. The tombs in the graveyard to the
north-west were in bad preservation. There was
at this spot a well known Ziarat called Kwajah
Mahommed, and the British Government has
given much pleasure to the natives by sanctioning
a "mufi" or remission of revenue for ever of all
the land belonging to this Ziarat in order to
provide for the support of it.</p>

<p>The people of the district are extremely
religious, and they have erected Mesjids and
Ziarats on every possible hill in the neighbourhood.
The most interesting is the Shah-Hussein
Ziarat, which has a curious legend of its own.
They say, that when the Arabs attacked Shah-Hussein,
he killed all his enemies by merely
praying to God. With their heads, which
suddenly turned into solid stone, he built the
Ziarat. The tomb is made, in fact, of round
stones, some of enormous size, evidently worn
into that shape by water, but the natives firmly
believe that they are petrified heads of Arabs!</p>

<p>Nushki is most conveniently situated in a large
valley with mountains sheltering it from the
north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west,
but from south-south-west to north
there is a stretch of open flat desert (the <i>Registan</i>,
or "country of sand") as far as the eye can see.
To the south of the bungalow is a hill range
stretching from north-north-east to south-south-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-424" id="Pg_2-424"></a>[<a href="./images/2-424.png">424</a>]</span>west,
and suddenly broken by the valley, through
which runs the stream which, then proceeding
along the Nushki plain from east to west, turns
in a graceful curve round the western side of the
hill on which the bungalow is situated, and
proceeds across the desert in a north-north-west
direction, where, having supplied several villages
and irrigated their fields, it eventually exhausts
itself in the desert. A broad river bed can be
noticed on the east side of and parallel with the
above hill range. The east side of these hills has
been much worn by water action; so much so
that actual holes and caves in the soft strata of
sand and gravel have been corroded by the water,
and these holes, as we have seen, are now inhabited
by destitute Beluch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us take a walk through the fast growing
city of Nushki. Half a dozen years ago there
was next to nothing here, but now we have a
beautiful <i>Tashil</i>&mdash;a large walled enclosure, with a
portico all round inside and circular towers at the
four corners. The actual Tashil office, occupying
the north-east corner, has a most business-like
appearance, with handsome iron despatch-boxes,
clocks that mark each a different time, but look
most imposing all the same, and folio-documents
folded in two and carefully arranged in piles upon
the floor by the side of wise-looking clerks squatting
in their midst. The Tashildar himself, Sardar
Mahommed Yuzaf Khan Popalzai, is a much respected
man of Afghan birth, of the Bamezi
Popalzai Durranis, or descendants of the tribe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-426" id="Pg_2-426"></a>[<a href="./images/2-426.png">426</a>]</span>
reigning in Cabul before Mahommed Zeis took
the throne, when his ancestors and the Saddo
Zeis were forcibly banished from the country.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-107.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-107_th.jpg" alt="The New City of Nushki. (overlooking the Tashil Buildings.)" title="The New City of Nushki. (overlooking the Tashil Buildings.)" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The New City of Nushki.</span> (overlooking the Tashil Buildings.)</p>

<p>The Tashildar, a most intelligent officer, seems
to understand the Beluch chiefs thoroughly, treats
them with extreme consideration&mdash;in private life
dealing with them as honoured guests, and politically
as Government subjects who must adhere
to their loyalty to the King.</p>

<p>There are also within the Tashil wall a post
and telegraph office and a treasury, a neat little
red brick building, with strong iron gates and
huge padlocks. Prisons are on either side of the
treasury, so that one single sentry may keep an
eye on both the prisoners and the local Government
funds.</p>

<p>When I visited the place an old man in chains
was squatting in the sun outside his cell. I inquired
what crime he had committed. His
daughter, they said, was betrothed to a young
man, and at the time appointed for the marriage
the old man did not bring the girl to the bridegroom
as stipulated. He had consequently already
been here in prison for two months to pay
for his folly, and would possibly have to remain
some months longer, for, according to Beluch
law&mdash;which is in force here&mdash;such a crime deserves
severe punishment.</p>

<p>Another prisoner&mdash;a cattle lifter&mdash;had a most
hideously criminal head. Prisoners were very
well cared for, had nice clean cells given them,
and were provided with plenty of food and
blankets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-427" id="Pg_2-427"></a>[<a href="./images/2-427.png">427</a>]</span></p>

<p>The Tashil establishment consisted of one
Tashildar, one <i>Sarishtedar</i> (clerk who reads
papers), one Judicial <i>Moharrir</i>, one <i>Kanungo</i>
(revenue clerk), three <i>patwaris</i>, one accountant in
treasury and one treasurer, one <i>chaprassi</i>, one petition
writer, one levy moonshee, one post and telegraph
master, one postman, one hospital assistant,
one compounder, three servants.</p>

<p>Next to the Tashil was the <i>thana</i> and Police-station,
with a police thanedar, one sergeant and
nine (Punjab) constables, as well as a levy
<i>jemadar</i> with one <i>duffadar</i> and ten <i>sawars</i>.</p>

<p>There is a practical little hospital at Nushki,
with eight beds and a dispensary, but the health
of the place seemed very good, and there were
no patients when I visited it. Moreover, it seems
that the Beluch prefer to be given medicine and
remain in their dwellings, except in cases of very
severe illness. The principal ailments from which
they suffer are small-pox, measles, and scurvy,
which in various stages is most prevalent among
the Beluch. Chest complaints are unknown
among them while they live out in the open air,
but when they are forcibly confined to rooms, for
instance as prisoners, they generally die of pneumonia
or develop consumption.</p>

<p>Two caravanserais are found at Nushki, one
for traders from Sistan, and one for caravans from
Quetta, and a mosque, so that the place is quite
a self-contained little town.</p>

<p>In front of the hospital one is rather staggered
by finding an actual tennis court laid down
according to the most precise rules, and no doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-428" id="Pg_2-428"></a>[<a href="./images/2-428.png">428</a>]</span>
in course of time we may expect golf links and
ping-pong tournaments which will mark further
steps towards the Anglicisation of that district.
But personally I was more interested in the local
bazaar, counting already 150 shops.</p>

<p>The Nushki bazaar is along a wide road kept
tidy and clean, and the place boasts of butcher-shops,
a washerman, one tailor marked by smallpox
and one who is not; <i>ghi</i> merchants with
large round casks outside their doors; cloth
merchants; blacksmiths and grain shops. In a
back street&mdash;for, indeed, Nushki boasts already
of two streets parallel with the main thoroughfare&mdash;under
a red flag hoisted over the premises is an
eating house&mdash;a restaurant for natives. The
merchants are mostly Hindoos from Sind.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">A Giant Beluch Recruit.</span> (Chaman.)</p>

<p>The land on which the shops have been built
has practically been given free by the Government
on condition that, if required back again at a future
date, the builder of the house upon the land
reclaimed is entitled, as an indemnity, only to the
restitution of the wood employed in the construction
of the house&mdash;the chief item of expense
in Nushki constructions.</p>

<p>Cotton goods, blue, red and white, seem to
command the greatest sale of any articles in
Nushki, after which the local trade consists of
wheat, almonds, barley, carpets (from Sistan),
wool, <i>kanawes</i> (cloth from Meshed), and cloths
imported from England, mostly cheap cottons;
camels, dates, etc.</p>

<p>The transit trade of Nushki is, however, very
considerable. The Government returns of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-429" id="Pg_2-429"></a>[<a href="./images/2-429.png">429</a>]</span>
trade that passed through Nushki during the
year from April, 1900, to April, 1901,
showed an aggregate of Rs.1,534,452, against Rs.1,235,411
for the preceding twelve months, while
two years before (1898-1899) the returns barely
amounted to Rs.728,082. Last year, 1901, the
trade returns made a further jump upwards
in the nine months from April to the end of
December, 1901, the imports amounting to
Rs.680,615, and the exports Rs.925,190, or
an aggregate of Rs.1,605,805, which is very
satisfactory indeed.</p>

<p>So much has been written of late about
Nushki, especially in connection with the new
railway, that I have very little to add. I most
certainly think that, strategically and commercially,
Nushki is bound to become a very important
centre, and, as far as trade goes, eventually
to supplant Quetta altogether, owing to its more
convenient position. The projected railway from
Quetta to Nushki will be a great boon to caravans,
both from Afghanistan and Persia, because
the severe cold of Quetta makes it very difficult
for camels to proceed there in winter, and camel
drivers have a great objection to taking their
animals there.</p>

<p>For any one looking ahead at the future and
not so much at the present, it seems, however,
almost a pity that the newly sanctioned railway
should not join Nushki with Shikarpur or Sibi
instead of Quetta, which would have avoided a
great and apparently almost useless detour.
Nushki will be found to develop so fast and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-430" id="Pg_2-430"></a>[<a href="./images/2-430.png">430</a>]</span>
greatly that, sooner or later, it will have to be
connected in a more direct line with more important
trading centres than Quetta. Quetta is
not a trading centre of any importance, and is
merely a military station leading nowhere into
British territory in a direct line.</p>

<p>However, even the Quetta-Nushki railway is
better than nothing, and will certainly have a
beneficial effect upon the country it will pass
through. From a military point of view the
railway as far as Nushki only is practically useless.
It is only a distance of some ninety odd
miles, through good country with plenty of
water and some grazing.</p>

<p>In England one reads in the papers and hears
people talk of this railway as the Quetta-Sistan
Railway, and people seem to be under the impression
that Nushki is on the Persian border.
It should be clearly understood that from Nushki
to Sistan (Sher-i-Nasrya) the distance, through
practically desert country and scanty water, is
over 500 miles. To my mind it is in the Robat-Nushki
portion of that distance, where travelling
is difficult, and for troops almost impossible, that
a railway is mostly needed. I have gone to
much trouble, and risked boring the reader, to
give all the differential altitudes upon the portion
of the road between Robat and Nushki, and it
will be seen that hardly anywhere does the track
rise suddenly to more than 50 or 100 feet at
most. The ground could easily be made solid
enough to lay a line upon; tanks for the water
supply might be established at various stations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-431" id="Pg_2-431"></a>[<a href="./images/2-431.png">431</a>]</span>
and a railway could be built with no trouble and
comparatively small expense.</p>

<p>Again, for the trade of Southern Persia, Robat
would, I think, be a fairly good terminus on the
Perso-Beluch frontier; but, in order to compete
with Russia in Sistan and Khorassan, it would be
a very good thing if the Government could enter
into an arrangement with Afghanistan, so that if
such a railway were built it should strike from
Dalbandin across the desert up to the Southern
bank of the Halmund, and have Sher-i-Nasrya
in Sistan for its terminus. This would do away
almost altogether&mdash;except in a small section&mdash;with
the difficulty of the water, and would
shorten the distance by at least one quarter.</p>

<p>The idea one often hears that it would be
dangerous to construct such a railway, because it
would be to open a passage for Russia into India,
is too ridiculous to be argued about. It might
be pointed out that the Russians on their side
seem not to reciprocate the fear of our invading
their country, for they are pushing their railways
from the north as far as they can towards the
Persian frontier, and it is stated that a concession
has been obtained by them for a railway line to
Meshed.</p>

<p>But, either <i>via</i> Robat or the Halmund, the
principal point is that if we do not wish to lose
Southern Persia we must push the railway with
the utmost speed, at least as far as the frontier.
Anything, in such a case, is better than nothing,
and most undoubtedly a telegraph line should be
established without delay&mdash;possibly as far as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-432" id="Pg_2-432"></a>[<a href="./images/2-432.png">432</a>]</span>
Sher-i-Nasrya Consulate. Matters are much more
urgent than we in England think, and if warning
is not taken we shall only have ourselves to blame
for the consequences.</p>

<p>From Nushki I went to a great extent along
the line which is to be followed by the future
railway. It seemed very sensibly traced, avoiding
expensive difficulties, such as tunnels, as much as
possible, but of course this railway has to go over
a good portion of mountainous country and
cannot be built on the cheap.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-110.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-110_th.jpg" alt="The Track between Nushki and Kishingi." title="The Track between Nushki and Kishingi." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">The Track between Nushki and Kishingi.</p>

<p>I left Nushki on the 31st, following a limpid
stream of water, and we began a zig-zag ascent
of the mountains before us to the east, leaving
behind to the north-east in a valley a large camp
of railway engineers and surveyors. After some
two miles we reached a broad valley, and we continued
to rise until we had reached the pass, 4,820
feet. On the other side we descended only 75 feet
to a plain&mdash;a plateau, with hill ranges rising on it,
and a barrier of higher mountains behind. The
vegetation here was quite different from anything
we had met in the desert, and <i>kotor</i> was plentiful&mdash;a
plant, the Beluch say, eaten by no animal.
Tamarisk seemed to flourish&mdash;it is a wonderful
plant that flourishes almost everywhere.</p>

<p>The plain was subdivided into three. In the
first portion, four miles wide, and one broad, the
<i>monguli</i> shrub was abundant, and, like the <i>kotor</i>,
was pronounced a useless plant, despised by all
beasts. In the second plain we found more <i>kotor</i>,
and in the last&mdash;very sandy&mdash;a lot of tamarisk.
The ground was cut about by numerous dry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-433" id="Pg_2-433"></a>[<a href="./images/2-433.png">433</a>]</span>
water-channels, and after a very easy march of
some eleven miles we came to the bungalow of
Kishingi, having ascended from 3,745 feet at the
Nushki Tashil to 4,720 feet at the Kishingi rest-house.
We had seen a great many white pillar
posts indicating the line of the future railroad.</p>

<p>We had now quite a different type of rest-houses&mdash;two-storied,
and very nice too, the two
rooms being comfortably enough furnished. A
caravanserai was attached to the bungalow.</p>

<p>Still going east we crossed another narrow
valley, through which the railway was traced, and
after going over a pass 5,250 feet we were in a
valley with a lot of <i>johr</i> growing upon it&mdash;a plant
which the Beluch say is deadly to man and beast
alike. On the top of the pass we saw a Mesjid,
and several more were found on descending on
the other side as well as a graveyard.</p>

<p>A curious white Mesjid was to be seen here
shaped like an 8, and erected on the site where a
Beluch had been killed. A conical mountain to
the south, the Mudonek Ateng, was famous, my
camel driver told me, because a Beluch fakir is
said to have remained on the top of it for 25
days without food or water. A small stone
shelter could be seen on the top of the mountain,
which, they say, had been the fakir's abode
during his long fast.</p>

<p>There is very little of special interest on this
well-known part of the route near Quetta. We
rose for several miles to a higher pass (5,700
feet), and were then on a higher flat plateau
with a high range stretching half-way across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-434" id="Pg_2-434"></a>[<a href="./images/2-434.png">434</a>]</span>
it from south-south-east to north-north-west.
One's attention was at once drawn to the north-east
by two renowned peaks in British Beluchistan,
the Chiltan, and further off the Takatu Mount.
At their foot on the other side lay Quetta. In
front of these we had the Hilti range stretching
north-west to south-east, ending in Mount Barag
on the north, and the two Askhan hills.</p>

<p>This part seemed more populated, and we left
to the east the tribe of Gurghena, comprising
four villages at intervals of about one mile
from one another. The last was situated in the
wide valley to the west of the Hilti range.
Other villages could be seen further in the valley
extending towards the south, which were
supplied with water by a river flowing along the
valley. A few <i>ghedan</i>, or low grass huts, were
scattered about the valley, and some black tents
5&frac12; feet high, with one side raised like an awning
by means of sticks. A pen for sheep was
erected near them with tamarisk branches and
sticks.</p>

<p>We were very thirsty and went to one of
these tents. The woman who occupied it gave
us some water, but, although in abject poverty,
angrily refused to accept a silver coin in payment,
saying that Beluch cannot be paid for hospitality.
Water costs nothing. God gives water for all
the people alike, and, if they were to accept
payment, misfortune would fall upon them.</p>

<p>Further on we passed the village of Paden,
with cultivation all round and plenty of water.
The chief had quite an imposing residence, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-435" id="Pg_2-435"></a>[<a href="./images/2-435.png">435</a>]</span>
a tower and castellated entrance gate, and the
characteristic cylindrical mangers for horses in
front of his dwelling. But although more
elaborate, even this house&mdash;the largest I had
seen&mdash;was absolutely devoid of windows, except
for a loop-hole to the east of the tower, which I
think was more for defensive purposes than for
ventilation's sake.</p>

<p>The village of Kardegap was seen next, and
we arrived at Morad Khan Kella (5,500 feet)
twenty-four miles from our last camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a ruined fort at Morad Khan Kella,
and half a mile off a Beluch village with two
towers. Each house had a separating wall
extending outwardly. The Beluch is wretched
if he is not secluded. The first thing he ever
wants to know is the exact extent of his
property, then he is quite happy and can live at
peace with his neighbours. As folks live more
outside their houses than indoors, I suppose such
a demarcation of property is necessary. Moreover,
people and beasts live in friendly intercourse,
and no doubt the beasts, which may be the
cherished pets of one man, may be just the
reverse to his neighbours. The houses were
rectangular and plastered over with mud.</p>

<p>The people here were not quite so friendly as
in other villages, and one began to feel the effects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-437" id="Pg_2-437"></a>[<a href="./images/2-437.png">437</a>]</span>
of nearing civilisation. Somebody, too, had
been at this people with a camera before, for I
hardly had time to take mine out of its case
before the whole population, which had collected
around, stampeded in all directions in the utmost
confusion. Only a little child&mdash;whom the
mother dropped in the hurry-scurry&mdash;was left
behind, and he was a quaint little fellow clad in
a long coloured gown and a picturesque red
hood.</p>

<p>We left Morad Khan Kella (5,430 feet) again
on February 2nd, along the vast plain which is
to be crossed by the future railway from north to
south (190&deg;). On nearing the Killi range we
came again to some high sand dunes rising in a
gentle gradient to 250 feet, their lowest point
being to the north, the highest to the south.
The plain itself on which we were travelling
(stretching from south-west to north-east) rose
gradually to 5,650 feet on undulating ground
with a number of sand hills, seven high long
dunes, and some minor ones.</p>

<p>We then came to a flat plain slanting northwards
and with high sand accumulations to the
south near the hill range. A rivulet of salt
water losing itself in the sand was found next,
and then we had to cross a pass 6,020 feet. One
obtained a beautiful view of the Mustang Mountains
to the south-east with two plains, intersected
by a high mountain range between us and them.
There were three tracks from this pass. One
south-east, called the Mustang track, the other
(north-east) the Tiri Road, and one, on which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-438" id="Pg_2-438"></a>[<a href="./images/2-438.png">438</a>]</span>
we were travelling, north-north-east (50&deg;) to
Kanak. The very high Kuh-i-Maran peak
could be seen in the distance to the south-east.</p>

<p>The railway will here follow the river which,
coming from Mustang, flows south-west to
Panchepoy. Then the line will proceed through
the gorge in the mountains to the west. Some
few miles from Kanak at the entrance of this
gorge were curious cuts in the sand, evidently
caused by water. Tamarisk was most luxuriant
here.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill2-111.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-111_th.jpg" alt="Taleri (Kanak). The new type of Rest House between Nushki and Quetta." title="Taleri (Kanak). The new type of Rest House between Nushki and Quetta." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Taleri (Kanak).</span> The new type of Rest House between Nushki and Quetta.</p>

<p>A small graveyard and a semi-natural Ziarat,
formed by a much contorted centenarian tamarisk
tree of abnormal proportions, were also to be
seen here. The branches had been twisted to
form a low doorway leading to a huge grave in
the centre of the enclosing oval formed by the
old tree and some other smaller ones. Large
round stones, as well as palm leaves, brooms, and
various implements had been deposited on the
grave; while suspended to the tree branches
over the doorway hung brass camel-bells and
tassels from camel collars.</p>

<p>During that day we had come across a great
many Mesjids, either single or in sets of three,
and several other Ziarats of no special importance.
In the valley of Kanak there were a number of
Beluch towns and villages, two at the foot of the
Shalkot Mountain and one in each valley to the
south of the track.</p>

<p>We made our last halt at the pagoda-like Bungalow
of Kanak, a comfortable large, black wood
verandah with a tiny dwelling in the centre,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-439" id="Pg_2-439"></a>[<a href="./images/2-439.png">439</a>]</span>
whitewashed walls, and a corrugated iron roof.
The man who built it was apparently more of a
mechanical engineer than an architect, and every
detail is carried out on some highly scientific
principle which impressed one much after the
less elaborate but very practical abodes we had
inhabited further east.</p>

<p>Here there was a gate suspended on long iron
rods besides the usual hinges, each screw had a
bolt at the end, and on proceeding inside, the
ceiling was supported on very neat but most
insecure-looking wooden bars no thicker than
three inches. A most ingenious theory of angles
kept up the heavy roof&mdash;why it did, Heaven
only knows! In contrast to the other bungalows,
where we had no glass at all, here we had glass
everywhere. One's bedroom door was two-thirds
made of the most transparent panes of glass that
could be got, and so were the two doors of the
bath-room&mdash;one leading directly on to the outside
verandah. The boards of the floor had
shrunk, and between the interstices one got a
bird's-eye view of what went on in the underlying
room.</p>

<p>A great deal of space and expense has been
devoted to outer show and scientific detail,
whereas the rooms were small, and unfortunate
was the man who tried to occupy the upper
room when a fire had been lighted in the
chimney of the room below. The bungalow
was, however, comfortably furnished, and from
its spacious verandah afforded a most magnificent
view all round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-440" id="Pg_2-440"></a>[<a href="./images/2-440.png">440</a>]</span></p>

<p>The high Chiltan Mountains above Shalkot
were on one side, and various picturesque hill
ranges stretched across the large plane dotted with
a Beluch village here and there.</p>

<p>In front of the entrance gate at the bungalow
a nice pool of water reflected in its more or less
limpid waters the images of over-leaning leafless
trees.</p>

<p>Whatever remarks one may make about the
construction of the bungalow it must be confessed
that it photographed well. (See illustration
facing page <a href="#Pg_2-438">438</a>).</p>

<p>The altitude of Kanak was 5,730 feet.</p>

<p>We made an early start on this our last march,
steering between the handsome Takatu Mountain
and the Chiltan, between which Quetta lies.
We met a number of Afghan women in long,
loose black gowns from neck to foot, and silver
ornaments round the neck and arms. They had
austere but handsome features with expressive
eyes.</p>

<p>About six miles from Quetta we struck the
wide Kandahar Road at the foot of the Takatu
Mountain. From this point we got the first
glimpse of Shalkot or Quetta. "Quetta" is the
English corruption, abbreviation, or adaptation,
if you please, of the word "Shalkot!" One
almost wished one could have trembled when
one stopped for a moment to read the first notice
in English on approaching the town, warning
new-comers of the dreadful things that would
happen to any one entering the town carrying a
camera or found sketching or taking notes!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-441" id="Pg_2-441"></a>[<a href="./images/2-441.png">441</a>]</span></p>

<p>It came on to snow as we approached the
place, and shortly after sunset my caravan entered
the neat, beautifully-kept roads of Quetta, and
behold, joy!&mdash;I heard for the first time since
August last the whistle of a railway engine.
This was on February 3rd, 1902.</p>

<p>I met with unbounded civility and hospitality
from everybody in Quetta as well as at Chaman,
our most north-westerly point on the Afghan
boundary. For those who believe in the unpreparedness
of England, it may be stated that,
from this point, we could with ease lay a railroad
to Kandahar in less than three weeks.</p>

<p>A most charming invitation from the Honourable
the Agent to the Governor-General and
Chief Commissioner in Beluchistan, Col. C. E.
Yate, C.S.I., C.M.G., etc., took me almost
directly to Sibi, where the annual horse show
and Beluch Durbar were to take place. A great
many locally-bred animals were exhibited, some
very good indeed. Camel, horse, and cow races
enlivened the show, and a very weird representation
of a Beluch raid was performed with much
<i>entrain</i>. At the Durbar, the leading Chiefs
were presented by Col. Yate with handsome
gold and silver embroidered coats, waistcoats,
scarves and turbans, and the scene was very
impressive.</p>

<p>One could not help again being struck by the
dignified, manly behaviour of the Beluch on one
side, and their frank respect for the British
officers,&mdash;a respect indeed well-deserved, for a
finer set of men in every way than our Political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-442" id="Pg_2-442"></a>[<a href="./images/2-442.png">442</a>]</span>
Service Officers can be found nowhere. It
is a pity we have not similar men <i>all</i> over
India.</p>

<p>From Sibi I travelled by rail across country to
Calcutta, where I arrived at the beginning of
March, having completed my journey overland&mdash;if
the short crossing from Baku to Enzeli be
excepted&mdash;from Flushing (Holland).</p>

<p class="illc">Beluch Boys off to the Races&mdash;Horse Fair at Sibi.</p>

<p>It never does to boast. I was feeling somewhat
proud to have travelled such a long
distance with no serious mishaps or accidents,
when, much to my sorrow, Sadek, my Persian
servant, returned one evening to the hotel
dreadfully smashed up. He had been attacked
in the bazaar by three Englishmen of Calcutta,
two of whom had held him down on the ground
while the third kicked him badly in the head,
body and legs. It appears that these three
ruffians had a grievance against Persians in
general, hence their heroic deed against a man
who had done them no harm.</p>

<p>It was indeed too bad to have to register that,
in a journey of over 10,000 miles, the only
people who had shown any barbarity were&mdash;in a
sort of way&mdash;my own countrymen!</p>

<p>Much as I love Beluchistan, I like India less
and less each time I go there. Maybe it is
because I always have misfortunes while in the
country. Indeed, I received a last and severe
blow while proceeding by train from Calcutta to
Bombay to catch a homeward steamer. My
faithful cat Lawah died, suffocated by the intense
moist heat in the carriage. The other two cats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-443" id="Pg_2-443"></a>[<a href="./images/2-443.png">443</a>]</span>
I just managed to keep alive by constant rubbing
with ice.</p>

<p>From Bombay I despatched Sadek back to
Teheran <i>via</i> the Gulf and Bushire, and the two
surviving cats and I sailed by P. &amp; O. for
England, where we all three arrived happy,
safe, and sound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-445" id="Pg_2-445"></a>[<a href="./images/2-445.png">445</a>]</span></p>
