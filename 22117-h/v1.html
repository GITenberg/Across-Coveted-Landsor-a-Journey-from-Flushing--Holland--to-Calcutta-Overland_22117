<h2>ACROSS COVETED LANDS</h2>

<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="V1-CHAPTER_I" id="V1-CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The start&mdash;The terrors of the Russian Custom-house&mdash;An
amusing incident at the Russian frontier&mdash;Politeness of
Russian officials&mdash;Warsaw: its sights; its lovely women&mdash;The
talented Pole&mdash;People who know how to travel by
train&mdash;A ludicrous scene.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">First</span> single to Baku," I requested when
my turn came at the window of the ticket office
at Victoria Station.</p>

<p>"Baku?&mdash;where is that?" queried the ticket
man.</p>

<p>"In Southern Russia."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see! Well, we cannot book further
than Warsaw for Russia."</p>

<p>"Warsaw will do. . . . . How much? . . .
Thank you."</p>

<p>My baggage having next been duly registered
direct for the capital of Poland, off I set to
Queenborough, crossed over by the night boat
to Flushing, and continued the following morning
by express to Berlin.</p>

<p>Once in the Russian train from the German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-2" id="Pg_1-2"></a>[<a href="./images/1-2.png">2</a>]</span>
capital one hears a great deal of the terrors of the
approaching Russian Custom-house, and here I
may relate rather an amusing incident which
will prove what these terrors amount to. In my
sleeping car there happened to be some French
merchants on their way to the fair of Nijni-Novgorod.
On perceiving my two rifles, a good-sized
ammunition case, and two cameras, one of
the gentlemen gratuitously informed me that if I
intended to proceed to Russia I had better leave
all these things behind, or they would all be confiscated
at the frontier. I begged to differ, and
the Frenchmen laughed boisterously at my
ignorance, and at what would happen presently.
In their imaginative minds they perceived my
valued firearms being lost for ever, and predicted
my being detained at the police station till it
pleased <i>les terribles Cossacques</i> to let me proceed.</p>

<p>"Evidently," shouted one of the Frenchmen
at the top of his voice, "this is your first journey
abroad. . . . <i>We</i>," he added, "are great travellers.
We have been once before in Russia."</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> great travellers!" I exclaimed, with
the emphasis very strong on the <i>are</i>, and pretending
intense admiration.</p>

<p>Naturally the Franco-Russian Alliance was
dragged into the conversation; were I a Frenchman
I might fare less badly. The Russians and
the French were brothers. But a British
subject! A hated Englishman bringing into
Russia two rifles, two revolvers, six hundred cartridges,
twelve hundred photographic plates, two
cameras, a large case of scientific instruments, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-3" id="Pg_1-3"></a>[<a href="./images/1-3.png">3</a>]</span>
of which I would duly declare! Why? Russia
was not England. I should soon experience how
Englishmen were treated in some countries.
"Russians," he exclaimed, "have not a polished
manner like the French. <i>Ah, non!</i> They are
semi-barbarians yet. They respect and fear the
French, but not the English. . . . <i>par exemple!</i>"</p>

<p>The frontier station of Alexandrovo was
reached, and a horde of terror-stricken passengers
alighted from the carriages, preceded and followed
by bags, portmanteaux, hold-alls, and bundles of
umbrellas, which were hastily conveyed to the
long tables of the huge Custom-house inspection
room.</p>

<p>The two Frenchmen had their belongings next
to mine on the long counter, and presently an
officer came. They were French subjects and
they had nothing to declare. Their elaborately
decorated bags were instantly ordered open and
turned upside down, while the officer searched
with some gusto among the contents now spread
on the table. There was a small pocket camera,
two packets of photographic plates, some soiled
handkerchiefs, collars and cuffs, a box of fancy
note-paper, a bottle of scent, a pair of embroidered
pantoufles, and a lot of patent brass
studs and cuff links.</p>

<p>With the exception of the soiled linen, everything
was seized, for all were liable to duty, and
some sharp words of reprimand were used by the
officer to my now subdued French neighbours for
attempting to smuggle.</p>

<p>The officer moved on to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-4" id="Pg_1-4"></a>[<a href="./images/1-4.png">4</a>]</span></p>

<p>"Monsieur," mournfully remarked the Frenchman,
"now <i>you</i> will be done for."</p>

<p>I declared everything and produced a special
permit, which had been very courteously given
me by the Russian Ambassador, and handed it
to the officer. Having eagerly read it, he stood
with his heels together and gave me a military
salute. With a profound bow he begged me to
point out to him all my luggage so that he could
have it stamped without giving me further
trouble. He politely declined to use the keys I
handed him, and thinking that I might feel
uncomfortable in the hustling crowd of people he
conveyed me to a chair in order that I might sit
down.</p>

<p>I turned round to look at the Frenchmen.
They had altogether collapsed.</p>

<p>"I thought you said that Englishmen were
hated in Russia, and that they would confiscate
all my things? You see they have confiscated
nothing," I meekly remarked to the Frenchmen,
when they returned to the sleeping car. "I do
not think that I have met with more polite
Customs officials anywhere."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, oui</i>," muttered the stouter Frenchman,
who was evidently in no mood to enter into further
conversation. "<i>Et nous autres b&ecirc;tes</i>," he soliloquized,
"<i>qui avons fait l'alliance avec ces sauvages
l&agrave;! On m'a tout pris m&ecirc;me le papier &agrave; lettres!</i>"</p>

<p>He removed his coat and waistcoat and the
many interesting patent appliances for holding
his tie in the correct position&mdash;where it never
remained&mdash;then he threw himself violently on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-5" id="Pg_1-5"></a>[<a href="./images/1-5.png">5</a>]</span>
the berth, face towards the wall, and grumbled
the greater part of the night on the stupid mistake
of the Franco-Russian Alliance. On his return
to France he would write a letter to the Ministre
des Affaires &Eacute;trang&egrave;res. After a long and tedious
soliloquy he fortunately fell asleep.</p>

<p>Warsaw on the Vistula, the old capital of
Poland, was reached in the morning.</p>

<p>The quickest way to Baku would have been to
proceed to Moscow and then by the so-called
"petroleum express," which leaves once a week,
every Tuesday, for Baku. Unluckily, I could
not reach Moscow in time, and therefore decided
to travel across Russia by the next best route, <i>via</i>
Kiev, Rostoff, and the Caspian. The few hours
I remained in Warsaw were pleasantly spent in
going about seeing the usual sights; the Palace
and lovely Lazienski gardens, laid out in the
old bed of the Vistula; the out-of-door theatre
on a small island, the auditorium being separated
by water from the stage; the lakes, the Saski
Ogrod, and the Krasinski public gardens; the
Jewish quarter of the town; the museums of
ancient and modern art.</p>

<p>There are few cities in Europe that are prettier,
cleaner, and more animated than Warsaw, and few
women in the world that have a better claim to
good looks than the Warsaw fair sex. The
majority of women one sees in the streets are
handsome, and carry themselves well, and their
dress is in good taste, never over-done as it is in
Paris, for instance.</p>

<p>The whole city has a flourishing appearance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-6" id="Pg_1-6"></a>[<a href="./images/1-6.png">6</a>]</span>
with its tramways, gay omnibuses, electric light,
telephones, and every modern convenience. The
streets are broad and cheerful. In the newer
parts of the city there are beautiful residences,
several of which, I was told, belong to British
subjects settled there. The Russian military
element is very strong, for Poland's love for
Russia is not yet very great. As we walk along
the main thoroughfares a long string of Cossacks,
in their long black felt cloaks and Astrakan caps,
canter along. They are a remarkably picturesque
and business-like lot of soldiers.</p>

<p>Poles are civility itself, that is, of course, if one
is civil to them.</p>

<p>Historically the place is of extreme interest,
and the battlefields of Novogeorgievsk, which
played such an important part in the Polish
insurrection of 1831, and of Grochowo, where
the Poles were defeated, are well worth a visit.
At Maciejowice, too, some fifty miles up the
Vistula, Kosciuzko was made prisoner by the
conquering Russians.</p>

<p>Warsaw is the third largest city in the Russian
Empire, and its favourable geographical position
makes it one of the great pivots of Eastern
Europe. With a navigable river and the great
main railway lines to important centres such as
Berlin, Vienna, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Dantzig,
Kiev, and Odessa, with good climatic conditions,
and fertile soil; with the pick of natural talent
in art and science, and the love for enterprise that
is innate in the Polish character, Warsaw cannot
help being a prosperous place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-7" id="Pg_1-7"></a>[<a href="./images/1-7.png">7</a>]</span></p>

<p>The city has very extensive suburbs. The
best known to foreigners, Praga, on the
opposite bank of the Vistula, is connected with
Warsaw by two iron bridges. Warsaw itself is
built on terraces, one above another, along the
bank of the river, but the main portion of the
city stands on a high undulating plain above.
There are over a hundred Catholic, several
Greek churches, and a number of synagogues;
a university, schools of art, academies, fourteen
monasteries, and two nunneries.</p>

<p>There are few places in the world where the
artisan or the common workman is more intelligent
and artistic, and where the upper classes
are more refined and soundly cultured, than in
Warsaw. With a certain reflex of the neighbouring
German commercial influence, the place
has become a thriving manufacturing and trading
centre. Machinery, excellent pianos and other
musical instruments, carriages, silver and electro-plate,
boots and leather goods are manufactured
and exported on a large scale. The tanneries of
Warsaw are renowned the world over, and the
Warsaw boots are much sought after all over the
Russian Empire for their softness, lightness and
durability. Then there are great exports of
wheat, flax, sugar, beer, spirits, and tobacco.</p>

<p>But time is short, and we must drive to the
station. Say what you will about the Russian,
there is a thing that he certainly knows how to
do. He knows how to travel by rail. One has
a great many preconceived ideas of the Russian
and his ways. One is always reminded that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-8" id="Pg_1-8"></a>[<a href="./images/1-8.png">8</a>]</span>
is a barbarian, that he is ignorant, that he is
dirty. He is possibly a barbarian in one way,
that he can differentiate good from bad, real
comfort from "optical illusions" or illusions of
any other kind, a thing highly civilised people
seem generally unable to do. This is particularly
noticeable in Russian railway travelling,&mdash;probably
the best and cheapest in the world.</p>

<p>To begin with, when you take a first-class
ticket it entitles you to a seat numbered and
reserved that nobody can appropriate. No
more tickets are sold than correspond with the
accommodation provided in the train. This
does away entirely with the "leaving one's
umbrella" business, to secure a seat, or scattering
one's belongings all over the carriage to ensure the
whole compartment to one's self, to the inconvenience
of other travellers. Then first, second
and third-class passengers are provided with
sleeping accommodation. The sleeping accommodation,
especially for first and second-class
passengers, consists of a wide and long berth
wherein they can turn round at their will, if
they please, not of a short, narrow bunk in
which even a lean person has to lie edgewise or
roll out, as in the continental sleeping car, for
which discomfort (rather than accommodation)
preposterous extra charges have to be paid,
above the first-class fare. Then, too, in the
latter the compartments are so small, so
ridiculously ventilated, that after one night
spent boxed in, especially if another passenger
shares the same cabin, one feels sick for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-9" id="Pg_1-9"></a>[<a href="./images/1-9.png">9</a>]</span>
hours, and in the day-time one has no room to
turn round, nor space to put one's legs. As for
the lighting, the less said the better. These
faults exist in our own and the continental first-class
compartments.</p>

<p>But the barbarian Russian knows and does
better. The line being of a very broad gauge,
his first-class carriages are extremely spacious and
very high, with large windows and efficacious
ventilators; and there is plenty of room everywhere
to spread one's limbs in every direction.
There is probably less gilding about the ceiling,
fewer nickel-plated catches about the doors; not
so much polished wood, nor ghastly coloured
imitation-leather paper, nor looking-glasses, but
very convenient folding-tables are found instead;
the seats are ample and serviceable, of plain,
handsome red velvet, devoid of the innumerable
dust-collecting button-pits&mdash;that striking feature
of British and continental railway-carriage decoration.
Movable cushions are provided for one's
back and head. There are bright electric lights
burning overhead, and adjustable reading lights
in the corners of the carriage. A corridor runs
along the whole train, and for a few kopeks
passengers can at any moment procure excellent
tea, caviare sandwiches, or other light refreshments
from attendants.</p>

<p>Now for the bedding itself. The Russian,
who is ever a practical man, carries his own
bedding&mdash;a couple of sheets, blankets, and small
pillow,&mdash;a custom infinitely cleaner and more
sensible than sleeping in dubious, smelly blankets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-10" id="Pg_1-10"></a>[<a href="./images/1-10.png">10</a>]</span>
of which one does not know who has used them
before, nor when they were washed last. But
if passengers wish, by paying a rouble (two
shillings) a night to the guard, bedding is provided
by the Railway. There is a fine <i>lavabo</i> at
the end of each carriage, with shampoo, hot and
cold water, etc. Here, too, by asking the guard,
towels are handed over to those passengers who
have not brought their own.</p>

<p>Here I may relate another amusing incident.
Unable to get at my towels packed in my registered
baggage, and ignorant of the Russian language,
I inquired of a polyglot fellow-passenger
what was the Russian word for towel, so that I
could ask the guard for one.</p>

<p>"<i>Palatiensi</i>," said he, and I repeated, "Palatiensi,
palatiensi, palatiensi," so as to impress the
word well upon my memory. Having enjoyed
a good wash and a shampoo, and dripping all
over with water, I rang for the guard, and sure
enough, when the man came, I could not recollect
the word. At last it dawned upon me
that it was,&mdash;"<i>Palatinski</i>," and "<i>Palatinski</i>," I
asked of the guard.</p>

<p>To my surprise the guard smiled graciously,
and putting on a modest air replied: "<i>Palatinski
niet, paruski</i> (I do not speak Latin, I speak only
Russian)," and the more I repeated "palatinski,"
putting the inflection now on one syllable, then
on the other, to make him understand, the more
flattered the man seemed to be, and modestly
gave the same answer.</p>

<p>This was incomprehensible to me, until my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-11" id="Pg_1-11"></a>[<a href="./images/1-11.png">11</a>]</span>
polyglot fellow-passenger came to my assistance.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you are asking the
guard?" he said in convulsions of laughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am asking for a 'palatinski'&mdash;a towel."</p>

<p>"No, you are not!" and he positively went
into hysterics. "Palatinski means 'Do you
speak Latin?' How can you expect a Russian
railway-guard to speak Latin? Look how incensed
the poor man is at being mistaken for a
Latin scholar! Ask him for a <i>palatiensi</i>, and he
will run for a towel."</p>

<p>The man did run on the magic word being
pronounced, and duly returned with a nice clean
<i>palatiensi</i>, which, however, was little use to me
for I had by this time nearly got dry by the
natural processes of dripping and evaporation.</p>

<p>One or two other similar incidents, and the
extreme civility one meets from every one while
travelling in Russia, passed the time away
pleasantly until Kiev, one of the oldest cities of
Russia, was reached.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tradition</span> tells us that Kiev was founded
before the Christian era, and its vicissitudes have
since been many and varied. It has at all times
been considered one of the most important
ecclesiastical centres of Russia,&mdash;if not indeed
the most important&mdash;but particularly since St.
Vladimir, the protecting saint of the city,
preached Christianity there in 988, this being
the first time that the religion of Christ had
been expounded in Russia. A century and a
half before that time (in 822) Kiev was the
capital city of the state and remained such till
1169. In 1240 it was captured by Mongols
who held it for 81 years. The Lithuanians
came next, and remained in possession for 249
years, until 1569; then Poland possessed it until
the year 1654, when it became part of the
Russian Empire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-13" id="Pg_1-13"></a>[<a href="./images/1-13.png">13</a>]</span></p>

<p>Kiev has the name of being a very intellectual
city. Somehow or other, intellectuality and
trade do not seem to go together, and although
the place boasts of a military school and arsenal,
theological colleges, a university, a school of
sacred picture painters, and a great many scientific
and learned societies, we find that none of these
are locally put to any marked practical use,
except the sacred-picture painting; the images
being disposed of very rapidly, and for comparatively
high prices all over the country.
Hardly any religious resorts are great commercial
centres, the people of these places being generally
conservative and bigoted and the ruling priestly
classes devoting too much attention to idealism
to embark in commercial enterprise, which leaves
little time for praying. Agriculture and horticulture
are encouraged and give good results.</p>

<p>The priests make money&mdash;plenty of it&mdash;by
their religion, and they probably know that there
is nothing more disastrous to religion in laymen
than rapid money-making by trade or otherwise.
With money comes education, and with education,
too powerful a light thrown upon superstition
and idolatry. It is nevertheless possible,
even probable, that in the ignorance of the
masses, in the fervent and unshaken confidence
which they possess in God, the Czar and their
leaders, may yet lie the greatest strength of
Russia. It must not be forgotten that half-educated,
or half uneducated, masses are probably
the weakness to-day of most other civilised
nations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-14" id="Pg_1-14"></a>[<a href="./images/1-14.png">14</a>]</span></p>

<p>Some business on a small scale, however, is
transacted at the various fairs held in Kiev, such
as the great fair at the beginning of the Russian
year. There are many beet-root sugar refineries,
the staple industry of the country, and next come
leather tanneries, worked leather, machinery,
spirits, grain and tobacco. Wax candles are
manufactured in huge quantities, and in the
monastery there is a very ancient printing-press
for religious books.</p>

<p>Peter the Great erected a fortress here in a
most commanding spot. It is said to contain
up-to-date guns. A special pass has to be
obtained from the military authorities to be
allowed to enter it, not so much because it is
used as an arsenal, but because from the high
tower a most excellent panoramic view is
obtained of the city, the neighbourhood, and the
course of the river down below.</p>

<p>But Kiev is famous above all for its monastery,
the Kievo-Petcherskaya, near which the two
catacombs of St. Theodosius and St. Antony
attract over three hundred thousand pilgrims
every year. The first catacomb contains forty-five
bodies of saints, the other eighty and the revered
remains are stored in plain wood or silver-mounted
coffins, duly labelled with adequate
inscriptions. The huge monastery itself bears
the appearance of great wealth, and has special
accommodation for pilgrims. As many as
200,000 pilgrims are said to receive board and
lodging yearly in the monastery. These are
naturally pilgrims of the lower classes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-15" id="Pg_1-15"></a>[<a href="./images/1-15.png">15</a>]</span></p>

<p>Enormous riches in solid gold, silver and
jewellery are stored in the monastery and are
daily increased by devout gifts.</p>

<p>But let us visit the catacombs.</p>

<p>The spare-looking, long-haired and bearded
priests at the entrance of the catacomb present
to each pilgrim, as a memento, a useful and
much valued wax candle, which one lights and
carries in one's hand down the steep and
slippery steps of the subterranean passages. All
along, the procession halts before mummified
and most unattractive bodies, a buzzing of
prayers being raised by the pilgrims when the
identity of each saint is explained by the priest
conducting the party. The more devout people
stoop over the bodies and kiss them fervently
all over, voluntarily and gladly disbursing in
return for the privilege all such small cash as
may lie idle in their pockets.</p>

<p>Down and down the crowd goes through
the long winding, cold, damp, rancid-smelling
passages, devoid of the remotest gleam of
ventilation, and where one breathes air so thick
and foul that it sticks to one's clothes and furs
one's tongue, throat and lungs for several hours
after one has emerged from the catacombs into
fresh air again. Yet there are hermit monks
who spend their lives underground without ever
coming up to the light, and in doing so become
bony, discoloured, ghastly creatures, with staring,
inspired eyes and hollow cheeks, half demented
to all appearance, but much revered and
respected by the crowds for their self-sacrifice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-16" id="Pg_1-16"></a>[<a href="./images/1-16.png">16</a>]</span></p>

<p>Further on the pilgrims drink holy water
out of a small cup made in the shape of a cross,
with which the liquid is served out from a
larger vessel. The expression of beatitude on
their faces as they sip of the holy water, and
their amazing reverence for all they see and
are told to do, are quite extraordinary to watch,
and are quite refreshing in these dying days of
idealism supplanted by fast-growing and less
poetic atheistic notions. The scowl I received
from the priest when my turn came and he
lifted the tin cross to my lips, is still well
impressed upon my mind. I drew back and
politely declined to drink. There was a
murmur of strong disapproval from all the
people present, and the priest grumbled something;
but really, what with the fetid smell
of tallow-candle smoke, the used-up air, and
the high scent of pilgrims&mdash;and religious people
ever have a pungent odour peculiar to themselves&mdash;water,
whether holy or otherwise, was
about the very beverage that would have
finished me up at that particular moment.</p>

<p>Glad I was to be out in the open air again,
driving through the pretty gardens of Kiev,
and to enjoy the extensive view from the high
cliffs overlooking the winding Dnieper River.
A handsome suspension bridge joins the two
banks. The river is navigable and during the
spring floods the water has been known to rise
as much as twenty feet.</p>

<p>The city of Kiev is situated on high undulating
ground some 350 feet above the river, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-17" id="Pg_1-17"></a>[<a href="./images/1-17.png">17</a>]</span>
up to 1837 consisted of the old town, Podol
and Petchersk, to which forty-two years later
were added Shulyavka, Solomenka, Kurenevka
and Lukyanovka, the city being divided into
eight districts. The more modern part of the
town is very handsome, with wide streets and
fine stone houses of good architecture, whereas
the poorer abodes are mostly constructed of
wood.</p>

<p>As in all the other cities of Russia there are
in Kiev a great many churches, over seventy
in all, the oldest of which is the Cathedral of
St. Sophia in the centre of the town, built as
early as 1037 on the spot where the Petchenegs
were defeated the previous year by Yarosloff.
It is renowned for its superb altar, its valuable
mosaics and the tombs of Russian grand-dukes.
Next in importance is the Church of the
Assumption, containing the bodies of seven
saints conveyed here from Constantinople. At
night the cross borne by the statue of Vladimir,
erected on a high point overlooking the Dnieper,
is lighted up by electricity. This luminous
cross can be seen for miles and miles all over
the country, and the effect is most impressive
and weird.</p>

<p>From Kiev I had to strike across country,
and the trains were naturally not quite so
luxurious as the express trains on the main
line, but still the carriages were of the same
type, extremely comfortable and spacious, and
all the trains corridor trains.</p>

<p>The next important city where I halted for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-18" id="Pg_1-18"></a>[<a href="./images/1-18.png">18</a>]</span>
a few hours was Kharkoff in the Ukraine, an
agricultural centre where beet-root was raised in
huge quantities and sugar manufactured from
it; wheat was plentiful, and good cattle, sheep
and horses were bred. The population was
mostly of Cossacks of the Don and Little
Russians. The industries of the place were
closely akin to farming. Agricultural implements
were manufactured; there were wool-cleaning
yards, soap and candle factories, wheat-mills,
brandy distilleries, leather tanneries, cloth
manufactories, and brick kilns.</p>

<p>The horse fairs at Kharkoff are patronised by
buyers from all parts of Russia, but to outsiders
the city is probably better known as the early
cradle of Nihilistic notions. Although quite a
handsome city, with fine streets and remarkably
good shops, Kharkoff has nothing special to
attract the casual visitor, and in ordinary times a
few hours are more than sufficient to get a fair
idea of the place.</p>

<p>With a railway ticket punched so often that
there is very little left of it, we proceed to
Rostoff, where we shall strike the main line
from Moscow to the Caucasus. Here is a
comparatively new city&mdash;not unlike the
shambling lesser Western cities of the United
States of America, with plenty of tumbling-down,
made-anyhow fences, and empty tin cans
lying everywhere. The streets are unpaved, and
the consequent dust blinding, the drinking
saloons in undue proportion to the number of
houses, and votka-drunken people in undue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-19" id="Pg_1-19"></a>[<a href="./images/1-19.png">19</a>]</span>
proportion to the population. Votka-drunkenness
differs from the intoxication of other liquors
in one particular. Instead of "dead drunk" it
leaves the individuals drunk-dead. You see a
disgusting number of these corpse-like folks lying
about the streets, cadaverous-looking and motionless,
spread flat on their faces or backs, uncared-for
by everybody. Some sleep it off, and, if not
run over by a droshki, eventually go home;
some sleep it on, and are eventually conveyed to
the graveyard, and nobody seems any the wiser
except, of course, the people who do not drink
bad votka to excess.</p>

<p>Rostoff stands at the head of the Delta of the
Don, a position of great strategical importance,
where of course the Russians have not failed to
build strong fortifications. These were begun
as early as 1761. Now very active ship-building
yards are found here, and extensive
caviare factories. Leather, wool, corn, soap,
ropes and tobacco are also exported, and the
place, apart from its military importance, is
steadily growing commercially. The majority
of shops seem to deal chiefly in American
and German made agricultural implements,
machinery and tools, and in firearms and knives
of all sizes and shapes. The place is not
particularly clean and certainly hot, dusty and
most unattractive. One is glad to get into the
train again and steam away from it.</p>

<p>As we get further South towards the Caucasus
the country grows more barren and hot, the dust
is appalling, but the types of inhabitants at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-20" id="Pg_1-20"></a>[<a href="./images/1-20.png">20</a>]</span>
little stations become very picturesque. The
Georgians are very fine people and the
Armenians too, in appearance at least. The
station sheds along the dusty steppes are guarded
by soldiers, presumably to prevent attacks on
the trains, and as one gets near the Caspian one
begins to see the wooden pyramids over oil wells,
and long freight trains of petroleum carried in
iron cylindrical tanks. The wells get more
numerous as we go along; the stations more
crowded with petroleum tanks. We are nearing
the great naphtha wells of Baku, where at
last we arrive, having travelled from Tuesday to
Sunday afternoon, or five days, except a few
hours' halt in Kiev, Kharkoff and Rostoff.</p>

<p class="illc">The Baku Oil Wells.</p>

<p>The first-class railway fare from Warsaw for
the whole journey was fully covered by a five-pound
note, and, mind you, could have been
done cheaper if one chose to travel by slower
trains on a less direct route!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> many accounts are heard of how one's
registered baggage in Russia generally arrives
with locks smashed and minus one's most valuable
property, and how unpunctual in arriving luggage
is, and how few passengers escape without having
their pockets picked before reaching their
destination&mdash;by the way, a fellow-passenger had
his pockets picked at the station of Mineralnya
Vod&mdash;that I was somewhat anxious to see my
belongings again, and fully expected to find that
something had gone wrong with them. Much
to my surprise, on producing the receipt at
the very handsome railway terminus, all my
portmanteaux and cases were instantly delivered
in excellent condition.</p>

<p>The Caspian Sea steamers for Persia leave
Baku on Sunday and Tuesday at midnight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-22" id="Pg_1-22"></a>[<a href="./images/1-22.png">22</a>]</span>
There was a fierce sand storm raging at the time
and the steamer had returned without being able
to land her passengers at their destination. I
decided to wait till the Tuesday. There is plenty
to interest one in Baku. I will not describe the
eternal fires, described so often by other visitors,
nor tell how naphtha was tapped for the first time
at this place, and how in 1886 one particular
well spouted oil with such tremendous force that
it was impossible to check it and it deluged a
good portion of the neighbourhood. A year
later, in 1887, another fountain rose to a height
of 350 ft. There are myriads of other lesser
fountains and wells, each covered by a wooden
shed like a slender pyramid, and it is a common
occurrence to see a big spout of naphtha rising
outside and high above the top of the wooden
shed, now from one well, now from another.</p>

<p>The process of bringing naphtha to the surface
under ordinary circumstances is simple and
effective, a metal cylinder is employed that has a
valve at the lower end allowing the tube to fill
while it descends, and closing automatically when
the tube is full and is being raised above ground
and emptied into pits provided for the purpose.
The naphtha then undergoes the process of refinement.
There are at the present moment
hundreds of refineries in Baku. The residue and
waste of naphtha are used as fuel, being very much
cheaper than coal or wood.</p>

<p>The greater number of wells are found a few
miles out of the town on the Balakhani Peninsula,
and the naphtha is carried into the Baku<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-23" id="Pg_1-23"></a>[<a href="./images/1-23.png">23</a>]</span>
refineries by numerous pipe lines. The whole
country round is, however, impregnated with oil,
and even the sea in one or two bays near Baku
is coated with inflammable stuff and can be
ignited by throwing a lighted match upon it.
At night this has a weird effect.</p>

<p>Apart from the oil, Baku&mdash;especially the
European settlement&mdash;has nothing to fascinate
the traveller. In the native city, Persian in type,
with flat roofs one above the other and the hill
top crowned by a castle and the Mosque of Shah
Abbas, constant murders occur. The native
population consists mostly of Armenians and
Persians. Cotton, saffron, opium, silk and salt
are exported in comparatively small quantities.
Machinery, grain and dried fruit constitute the
chief imports.</p>

<p>The crescent-shaped Baku Bay, protected as it
is by a small island in front of it, affords a safe
anchorage for shipping. It has good ship-yards
and is the principal station of the Russian fleet in
the Caspian. Since Baku became part of the
Russian Empire in 1806 the harbour has been
very strongly fortified.</p>

<p>The most striking architectural sight in Baku
is the round Maiden's Tower by the water edge,
from the top of which the lovely daughter of
the Khan of Baku precipitated herself on to the
rocks below because she could not marry the man
she loved.</p>

<p>The most depressing sight in Baku is the
vegetation, or rather the strenuous efforts of the
lover of plants to procure verdure at all costs in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-24" id="Pg_1-24"></a>[<a href="./images/1-24.png">24</a>]</span>
the gardens. It is seldom one's lot to see trees
and plants look more pitiable, notwithstanding
the unbounded care that is taken of them. The
terrific heat of Baku, the hot winds and sand-storms
are deadly enemies to vegetation. Nothing
will grow. One does not see a blade of
grass nor a shrub anywhere except those few
that are artificially brought up. The sand is
most trying. It is so fine that the wind forces
it through anything, and one's tables, one's
chairs, one's bed are yellow-coated with it. The
tablecloth at the hotel, specklessly white when
you begin to dine, gets gradually yellower at
sight, and by the time you are half through
your dinner the waiter has to come with a
brush to remove the thick coating of dust on
the table.</p>

<p>These are the drawbacks, but there is an air
of prosperity about the place and people that
is distinctly pleasing, even although one may
not share in it. There is quite a fair foreign
community of business people, and their activity
is very praiseworthy. The people are very
hospitable&mdash;too hospitable. When they do not
talk of naphtha, they drink sweet champagne in
unlimited quantities. But what else could they
do? Everything is naphtha here, everything
smells of naphtha, the steamers, the railway
engines are run with naphtha. The streets are
greasy with naphtha. Occasionally&mdash;frequently
of late&mdash;the monotony of the place is broken
by fires of gigantic proportions on the premises
of over-insured well-owners. The destruction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-25" id="Pg_1-25"></a>[<a href="./images/1-25.png">25</a>]</span>
to property on such occasions is immense, the
fires spreading with incalculable rapidity over an
enormous area, and the difficulty of extinguishing
them being considerable.</p>

<p>When I was in Baku the Amir of Bokhara
was being entertained in the city as guest of
the Government. His suite was quartered in
the Grand Hotel. He had taken his usual
tour through Russia and no trouble had been
spared to impress the Amir with the greatness
of the Russian Empire. He had been given a
very good time, and I was much impressed
with the pomp and cordiality with which he
was treated. Neither the Governor nor any
of the other officials showed him the usual
stand-off manner which in India, for instance,
would have been used towards an Asiatic
potentate, whether conquered by us or otherwise.
They dealt with him as if he had been a
European prince&mdash;at which the Amir seemed
much flattered. He had a striking, good-natured
face with black beard and moustache,
and dark tired eyes that clearly testified to
Russian hospitality.</p>

<p>I went to see him off on the steamer which
he kept waiting several hours after the advertised
time of departure. He dolefully strode on board
over a grand display of oriental rugs, while the
military brass band provided for the occasion
played Russian selections. Everybody official
wore decorations, even the captain of the merchant
ship, who proudly bore upon his chest a
brilliant star&mdash;a Bokhara distinction received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-26" id="Pg_1-26"></a>[<a href="./images/1-26.png">26</a>]</span>
from the Amir on his outward journey for navigating
him safely across the Caspian.</p>

<p class="illc">The Amir of Bokhara leaving Baku to return to his Country.</p>

<p>The Amir's suite was very picturesque, some
of the men wearing long crimson velvet gowns
embroidered in gold, others silk-checked garments.
All had white turbans. The snapshot
reproduced in the illustration shows the Amir
accompanied by the Governor of Baku just
stepping on board.</p>

<p>There is a regular mail service twice a week
in summer, from April to the end of October,
and once a week in winter, on the Caspian
between Baku and Enzeli in Persia, the Russian
Government paying a subsidy to the Kavkas and
Mercury Steam Navigation Company for the
purpose of conveying passengers, mails (and, in
the event of war, troops) into Persia and back.
There are also a number of coasting steamers
constantly plying between the various ports on
the Caspian both on the Russian and Persian
coast.</p>

<p>The hurricane having abated there was a prospect
of a fair voyage and the probability of
landing at Enzeli in Persia, so when the Tuesday
came I went on board the old rickety paddle-steamer
(no less than forty-five years old) which
was to convey me to that port. She was one of
the Mercury-Caucasus Co. fleet, and very dirty
she was, too.</p>

<p>It is perhaps right to mention that for the
first time in Russia, purposeless rudeness and
insolence came to my notice on the part of the
ticket officials of the Mercury line. They be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-27" id="Pg_1-27"></a>[<a href="./images/1-27.png">27</a>]</span>haved
like stupid children, and were absolutely
incompetent to do the work which had been
entrusted to them. They were somewhat surprised
when I took them to task and made
them "sit up." Having found that they had
played the fool with the wrong man they instantly
became very meek and obliging. It is
nevertheless a great pity that the Mercury Company
should employ men of this kind who, for
some aim of their own, annoy passengers, both
foreign and Russian, and are a disgrace to the
Company and their country.</p>

<p>On board ship the captain, officers and
stewards were extremely civil. Nearly all the
captains of the Caspian steamers were Norwegian
or from Finland, and were jolly fellows. The
cabins were very much inhabited, so much so
that it was difficult to sleep in them at all.
Insects so voracious and in such quantities and
variety were in full possession of the berths, that
they gave one as lively a night as it is possible
for mortals to have. Fortunately the journey
was not a long one, and having duly departed
at midnight from Baku I reached Lenkoran the
next day, with its picturesque background of
mountains and thickly-wooded country. This
spot is renowned for tiger-shooting.</p>

<p>Our next halt was at Astara, where there were
a number of wooden sheds and drinking saloons,&mdash;a
dreadful place, important only because on
the Perso-Russian boundary line formed by the
river of the same name. We landed here a
number of police officers, who were met by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-28" id="Pg_1-28"></a>[<a href="./images/1-28.png">28</a>]</span>
deputation of some fifty Persian-looking men,
who threw their arms round their necks and in turn
lustily kissed them on both cheeks. It was a
funny sight. When we got on board again after
a couple of hours on shore the wind rose and we
tossed about considerably. Another sleepless
night on the "living" mattress in the bunk, and
early in the morning we reached the Persian
port of Enzeli.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> calls Enzeli a "port" <i>pour fa&ccedil;on de
parler</i>, for Persia has no harbours at all on the
Caspian sea. Enzeli, Meshed-i-Sher or Astrabad,
the three principal landing places on the Persian
coast, have no shelter for ships, which have to
lie a good distance out at sea while passengers
and cargo are transhipped by the Company's
steam launch or&mdash;in rough weather&mdash;by rowing
boats. In very rough weather it is impossible
to effect a landing at all, and&mdash;this is a most
frequent occurrence on the treacherous Caspian&mdash;after
reaching one's journey's end one has to
go all the way back to the starting point and
begin afresh. There are people who have been
compelled to take the journey four or five times
before they could land, until the violent storms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-30" id="Pg_1-30"></a>[<a href="./images/1-30.png">30</a>]</span>
which often rage along the Persian coast had
completely subsided and allowed the flimsy steam-launch
at Enzeli to come out to meet the
steamers, lying about a mile outside.</p>

<p>We had passengers on board who had been
unable to land on the previous journey, and were
now on their second attempt to set foot in
Persia. We were rolling a good deal when we
cast anchor, and after waiting some hours we
were informed that it was too rough for the
steam-launch to come out. The captain feared
that he must put to sea again, as the wind was
rising and he was afraid to remain so near the
coast. Two rowing boats eventually came out,
and with some considerable exertion of the
rowers succeeded in getting near the steamer. I
immediately chartered one, and after a good deal
of see-saw and banging and knocking and
crackling of wood alongside the steamer, my
baggage and I were transhipped into the flat-bottomed
boat. Off we rowed towards the
shore, getting drenched each time that the boat
dipped her nose into the sea.</p>

<p>The narrow entrance of the Enzeli bay is
blocked by a sand-bar. The water is here very
shallow, only about six feet deep. Riding on
the top of the breakers was quite an experience,
and we occasionally shipped a good deal of water.
We, however, landed safely and had to pay pretty
dearly for the convenience. The boatmen do not
run the risk of going out for nothing, and when
they do, take every advantage of passengers who
employ them. I was fortunate to get off by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-31" id="Pg_1-31"></a>[<a href="./images/1-31.png">31</a>]</span>
giving a backshish of a few <i>tomans</i> (dollars),
but there are people who have been known to
pay three, four and even five pounds sterling to
be conveyed on shore.</p>

<p>Here, too, thanks to the civility of the Persian
Ambassador in London, I had a special permit
for my firearms, instruments, etc., and met with
the greatest courtesy from the Belgian and
Persian officers in the Customs. It is necessary
to have one's passport in order, duly <i>vis&eacute;</i> by the
Persian Consul in London, or else a delay might
occur at Enzeli.</p>

<p>There is a lighthouse at Enzeli, the Customs
buildings and a small hotel. From this point a
lagoon, the Murd-ap has to be crossed, either
by the small steam-launch or by rowing boat.
As there seemed to be some uncertainty about
the departure of the launch, and as I had a good
deal of luggage, I preferred the latter way.
Eight powerful men rowed with all their might
at the prospect of a good backshish; and we
sped along at a good pace on the placid waters of
the lagoon, in big stretches of open water, now
skirting small islands, occasionally through narrow
canals, the banks of which were covered with
high reeds and heavy, tropical, confused, untidy
vegetation. The air was still and stifling&mdash;absolutely
unmoved, screened as it was on all
sides by vegetation. The sailors sang a monotonous
cadence, and the boat glided along for
some three hours until we arrived at the mouth
of the Piri river, hardly wide enough for a
couple of boats to go through simultaneously,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-32" id="Pg_1-32"></a>[<a href="./images/1-32.png">32</a>]</span>
and so shallow that rowing was no longer
practicable.</p>

<p>The men jumped off, tied the towing rope
that hung from the mast to their belts, and
ran along the banks of the Piri river, the water
of which was almost stagnant. An hour or so
later we suddenly came upon a number of
boats jammed together in the miniature harbour
of Piri Bazaar&mdash;a pool of putrid water a few
feet in circumference. As the boat gradually
approached, a stone-paved path still separated
from you by a thick wide layer of filthy mud
wound its way to the few miserable sheds&mdash;the
bazaar&mdash;up above. A few trays of grapes,
some Persian bread, some earthenware pottery
of the cheapest kind, are displayed in the shop
fronts&mdash;and that is all of the Piri-Bazaar. On
landing at Enzeli one hears so much of
Piri-Bazaar that one gets to imagine it a
big, important place,&mdash;and as it is, moreover,
practically the first really typical Persian place
at which one touches, the expectations are high.
Upon arrival there one's heart sinks into one's
boots, and one's boots sink deep into black
stinking mud as one takes a very long&mdash;yet
much too short&mdash;jump from the boat on to
what one presumes to be <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>With boots clogged and heavy with filth,
a hundred people like ravenous birds of prey
yelling in your ears (and picking your pockets
if they have a chance), with your luggage
being mercilessly dragged in the mud, with
everybody demanding backshish on all sides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-33" id="Pg_1-33"></a>[<a href="./images/1-33.png">33</a>]</span>
tapping you on the shoulder or pulling your
coat,&mdash;thus one lands in real Persia.</p>

<p>In the country of Iran one does not travel for
pleasure nor is there any pleasure in travelling.
For study and interest, yes. There is plenty
of both everywhere.</p>

<p>Personally, I invariably make up my mind
when I start for the East that no matter what
happens I will on no account get out of temper,
and this self-imposed rule&mdash;I must admit&mdash;was
never, in all my travels, tried to the
tantalising extent that it was in the country
of the Shah. The Persian lower classes&mdash;particularly
in places where they have come
in contact with Europeans&mdash;are well-nigh
intolerable. There is nothing that they will
not do to annoy you in every possible way,
to extort backshish from you. In only one
way do Persians in this respect differ from
other Orientals. The others usually try to
obtain money by pleasing you and being useful
and polite, whereas the Persian adopts the
quicker, if not safer, method of bothering you
and giving you trouble to such an unlimited
degree that you are compelled to give something
in order to get rid of him. And in a
country where no redress can be obtained from
the police, where laws do not count, and where
the lower classes are as corrupt and unscrupulous
as they are in the more civilised parts of Persia
(these remarks do not apply to the parts
where few or no Europeans have been) the
only way to save one's self from constant worry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-34" id="Pg_1-34"></a>[<a href="./images/1-34.png">34</a>]</span>
and repressed anger&mdash;so bad for one's health&mdash;is
to make up one's mind at once to what
extent one is prepared to be imposed upon,
and leave the country after. That is to say,
if one does not wish to adopt the only other
and more attractive alternative of inflicting
summary justice on two-thirds of the natives
one meets,&mdash;too great an exertion, to be sure,
in so hot a climate.</p>

<p>They say that Persia is the country that
our stock came from. It is quite possible, and
if so we are indeed to be congratulated upon
having morally improved so much since, or
the Persians to be condoled with on their sad
degeneration. The better classes, however, are
very different, as we shall see later.</p>

<p>Personally, I adopted the first method suggested
above, the easier of the two, and I
deliberately put by what I thought was a fair
sum to be devoted exclusively to extortion.
On leaving the country several months later,
much to my astonishment I found that I had
not been imposed upon half as much as I
expected, although I had stayed in Persia double
the time I had intended. Maybe this can be
accounted for by my having spent most of my
time in parts not so much frequented by Europeans.
Indeed, if the Persian is to-day the perfidious
individual he is, we have to a great extent
only ourselves to blame for making him so.</p>

<p>Keeping my temper under control, and an
eye on my belongings, I next hired a carriage
to convey me to the town of Resht, seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-35" id="Pg_1-35"></a>[<a href="./images/1-35.png">35</a>]</span>
miles distant. In damp heat, that made one's
clothes moist and unpleasant, upon a road
muddy to such an extent that the wheels sank
several inches in it and splashed the passenger
all over, we galloped through thick vegetation
and patches of agriculture, and entered the
city of Resht. Through the narrow winding
streets of the bazaar we slowed down somewhat
in some places, the carriage almost touching
the walls of the street on both sides. The
better houses possess verandahs with banisters
painted blue, while the walls of the buildings
are generally white.</p>

<p>One is struck by the great number of shoe
shops in the bazaar, displaying true Persian shoes
with pointed turned-up toes,&mdash;then by the brass
and copper vessel shops, the ancient and
extremely graceful shapes of the vessels and
amphoras being to this date faithfully preserved
and reproduced. More pleasing still to the eye
are the fruit shops, with huge trays of water-melons,
cucumbers, figs, and heaps of grapes.
The latter are, nevertheless, not so very tasty to
the palate and do not compare with the delicate
flavour of the Italian or Spanish grapes.</p>

<p>Somewhat incongruous and out-of-place, yet
more numerous than truly Persian shops, are the
semi-European stores, with cheap glass windows
displaying inside highly dangerous-looking
kerosene lamps, badly put together tin goods,
soiled enamel tumblers and plates, silvered glass
balls for ceiling decoration, and the vilest
oleographs that the human mind can devise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-36" id="Pg_1-36"></a>[<a href="./images/1-36.png">36</a>]</span>
only matched by the vileness of the frames.
Small looking-glasses play an important part in
these displays, and occasionally a hand sewing-machine.
Tinned provisions, wine and
liquor shops are numerous, but unfortunate is
the man who may have to depend upon them
for his food. The goods are the remnants of
the oldest stocks that have gradually drifted,
unsold, down to Baku, and have eventually been
shipped over for the Persian market where
people do not know any better. Resht is the
chief city in the Ghilan province.</p>

<p>Ghilan's trade in piece-goods is about two-thirds
in the hands of Russia, while one-third
(or even less) is still retained by England,&mdash;Manchester
goods. This cannot well be helped,
for there is no direct route from Great Britain
to Resht, and all British goods must come
through Bagdad, Tabriz, or Baku. The two
first routes carry most of the trade, which
consists principally of shirtings, prints, cambrics,
mulls, nainsooks, and Turkey-reds, which are
usually put down as of Turkish origin, whereas
in reality they come from Manchester, and are
merely re-exported, mainly from Constantinople,
by native firms either in direct traffic or in
exchange for goods received.</p>

<p>One has heard a great deal of the enormous
increase in trade in Persia during the last couple
of years or so. The increase has not been in the
trade itself, but in the collection of Customs dues,
which is now done in a regular and business like
fashion by competent Belgian officials, instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-37" id="Pg_1-37"></a>[<a href="./images/1-37.png">37</a>]</span>
by natives, to whom the various collecting stations
were formerly farmed out.</p>

<p>It will not be very easy for the British trader
to compete successfully with the Russian in
northern Persia, for that country, being
geographically in such close proximity, can
transport her cheaply made goods at a very low
cost into Iran. Also the Russian Government
allows enormous advantages to her own traders
with Persia in order to secure the Persian
market, and to develop her fast-increasing
industrial progress,&mdash;advantages which British
traders do not enjoy. Still, considering all the
difficulties British trade has to contend with in
order to penetrate, particularly into Ghilan, it is
extraordinary how some articles, like white
Manchester shirtings, enjoy practically a
monopoly, being of a better quality than similar
goods sent by Russia, Austria, Hungary,
Germany, Italy or Holland.</p>

<p>Loaf sugar, which came at one time almost
entirely from France, has been cut out by
Russian sugar, which is imported in large
quantities and eventually finds its way all over
Persia. It is of inferior quality, but very much
cheaper than sugar of French manufacture, and
is the chief Russian import into Ghilan.</p>

<p>Tobacco comes principally from Turkey and
Russia. In going on with our drive through the
bazaar we see it sold in the tiny tobacco shops,
where it is tastily arranged in heaps on square
pieces of blue paper, by the side of Russian and
Turkish cigarettes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-38" id="Pg_1-38"></a>[<a href="./images/1-38.png">38</a>]</span></p>

<p class="illc">Persian Wrestling.</p>

<p>And now for the Resht Hotels. Here is an
Armenian hotel&mdash;European style. From the
balcony signs and gesticulations and shouts in
English, French, and Russian endeavour to
attract the passer-by&mdash;a youth even rushes to the
horses and stops them in order to induce the
traveller to alight and put up at the hostelry; but
after a long discussion, on we go, and slowly
wind our way through the intricate streets
crowded with men and women and children&mdash;all
grumbling and making some remark as one
goes by. At one point a circle of people
squatting in the middle of a road round a pile of
water-melons, at huge slices of which they each
bit lustily, kept us waiting some time, till they
moved themselves and their melons out of the
way for the carriage to pass. Further on a
soldier or two in rags lay sleeping flat on the
shady side of the road, with his pipe (kalian)
and his sword lying by his side. Boys were
riding wildly on donkeys and frightened women
scrambled away or flattened themselves against
the side walls of the street, while the hubs of the
wheels shaved and greased their ample black silk
or cotton trousers made in the shape of sacks, and
the horses' hoofs splashed them all over with
mud. The women's faces were covered with a
white cloth reaching down to the waist. Here,
too, as in China, the double basket arrangement
on a long pole swung across the shoulders was
much used for conveying loads of fruit and
vegetables on men's shoulders;&mdash;but least
picturesque of all were the well-to-do people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-39" id="Pg_1-39"></a>[<a href="./images/1-39.png">39</a>]</span>
of the strong sex, in short frock-coats pleated
all over in the skirt.</p>

<p>One gets a glimpse of a picturesque blue-tiled
pagoda-like roof with a cylindrical column upon
it, and at last we emerge into a large quadrangular
square, with European buildings to the west side.</p>

<p>A little further the British flag flies gaily in
the wind above H.M.'s Consulate. Then we
come upon a larger building, the Palace of the
Governor, who, to save himself the trouble and
expense of having sentries at the entrances,
had life-size representations of soldiers with
drawn swords painted on the wall. They are
not all represented wearing the same uniform, as
one would expect with a guard of that kind, but
for variety's sake some have red coats, with plenty
of gold braiding on them, and blue trousers,
the others blue coats and red trousers.
One could not honestly call the building a
beautiful one, but in its unrestored condition it is
quite picturesque and quaint. It possesses a
spacious verandah painted bright blue, and two
windows at each side with elaborate ornamentations
similarly coloured red and blue. A red-bordered
white flag with the national lion in the
centre floats over the Palace, and an elaborate
castellated archway, with a repetition of the
Persian Lion on either side, stands in front of the
main entrance in the square of the Palace. So
also do four useful kerosene lamp-posts. The
telegraph office is to the right of the Palace with
a pretty garden in front of it.</p>

<p>The most important political personage living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-40" id="Pg_1-40"></a>[<a href="./images/1-40.png">40</a>]</span>
in Resht is His Excellency Salare Afkham,
called Mirza Fathollah Khan, one of the richest
men in Persia, who has a yearly income of some
twenty thousand pounds sterling. He owns a
huge house and a great deal of land round Resht,
and is much respected for his talent and kindly
manner. He was formerly Minister of the
Customs and Posts of all Persia, and his chest is
a blaze of Russian, Turkish and Persian
decorations of the highest class, bestowed upon
him by the various Sovereigns in recognition of
his good work. He has for private secretary Abal
Kassem Khan, the son of the best known of
modern Persian poets, Chams-echo&eacute;ra, and
himself a very able man who has travelled all
over Asia, Turkestan and Europe.</p>

<p>Persia is a country of disappointments. There
is a general belief that the Swiss are splendid
hotel-keepers. Let me give you my experience
of the hotel at Resht kept by a Swiss.</p>

<p>"Can this be the Swiss hotel?" I queried to
myself, as the driver pulled up in front of an
appallingly dirty flight of steps. There seemed
to be no one about, and after going through the
greater part of the building, I eventually came
across a semi-starved Persian servant, who
assured me that it was. The proprietor, when
found, received me with an air of condescension
that was entertaining. He led me to a room
which he said was the best in the house. On
inspection, the others, I agreed with him, were
decidedly not better. The hotel had twelve bedrooms
and they were all disgustingly filthy. True<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-41" id="Pg_1-41"></a>[<a href="./images/1-41.png">41</a>]</span>
enough, each bedroom had more beds in it than
one really needed, two or even three in each
bedroom, but a <i>coup-d'&oelig;il</i> was sufficient to assure
one's self that it was out of the question to make
use of any of them. I counted four different
coloured hairs, of disproportionate lengths and
texture, on one bed-pillow in my room, leaving
little doubt that no less than four people had
laid their heads on that pillow before; and the
pillow of the other bed was so black with dirt
that I should imagine at least a dozen consecutive
occupants of that couch would be a low
estimate indeed. As for the sheets, blankets, and
towels, we had better draw a veil. I therefore
preferred to spread my own bedding on the floor,
and slept there. The hotel boasted of three large
dining-rooms in which a few moth-eaten stuffed
birds and a case or two of mutilated butterflies,
a couple of German oleographs, which set one's
teeth on edge, and dusty, stamped cotton hangings
formed the entire decoration.</p>

<p>To give one an appetite&mdash;which one never
lost as long as one stayed there&mdash;one was informed
before dinner that the proprietor was
formerly the Shah's cook. After dinner one felt
very, very sorry for the poor Shah, and more so
for one's self, for having put up at the hotel. But
there was no other place in Resht, and I stuck
to my decision that I would never get angry, so
I stood all patiently. The next day I would
start for Teheran.</p>

<p>One talks of Persian extortion, but it is nothing
to the example offered to the natives by Euro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-42" id="Pg_1-42"></a>[<a href="./images/1-42.png">42</a>]</span>peans
in Persia. The charges at the hotel were
exorbitant. One paid as much per day as one
would at the very first hotel in London, New
York, or Paris, such as the Carlton, the Waldorf,
or Ritz. Only here one got absolutely nothing
for it except very likely an infectious disease, as
I did. In walking bare-footed on the filthy matting,
while taking my bath, some invisible germ
bored its way into the sole of my right foot and
caused me a good deal of trouble for several
weeks after. Animal life in all its varieties was
plentiful in all the rooms.</p>

<p>Previous to starting on the long drive to the
capital I had to get some meat cooked for use on
the road, but it was so putrid that even when I
flung it to a famished pariah dog he refused to eat
it. And all this, mind you, was inexcusable, because
excellent meat, chickens, eggs, vegetables,
and fruit, can be purchased in Resht for a mere
song, the average price of a good chicken, for instance,
being about 5<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i>, a whole sheep costing
some eight or ten shillings. I think it is only
right that this man should be exposed, so as to put
other travellers on their guard, not so much for
his overcharges, for when travelling one does not
mind over-paying if one is properly treated, but
for his impudence in furnishing provisions that
even a dog would not eat. Had it not been that
I had other provisions with me I should have
fared very badly on the long drive to Teheran.</p>

<p>It may interest future travellers to know that
the building where the hotel was at the time of
my visit, August, 1901, has now been taken over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-43" id="Pg_1-43"></a>[<a href="./images/1-43.png">43</a>]</span>
for five years by the Russian Bank in order to
open a branch of their business in Resht, and
that the hotel itself, I believe, has now shifted
to even less palatial quarters!</p>

<p>The Imperial Bank of Persia has for some
years had a branch in Resht, and until 1901 was
the only banking establishment in the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Resht</span> is an odious place in every way. It is,
as it were, the "Port Said" of Persia, for here
the scum of Armenia, of Southern Russia, and of
Turkestan, stagnates, unable to proceed on the
long and expensive journey to Teheran. One
cannot go out for a walk without being accosted
by any number of impostors, often in European
clothes, who cling like leeches and proceed to try
to interest you in more or less plausible swindles.
One meets a great many people, too, who are on
the look out for a "lift" in one's carriage to the
Persian capital.</p>

<p>I paid quite an interesting visit to a near
relation of the Shah's, who was the guest of the
local Head Mullah. The approach to the
Mullah's palace was not attractive. I was conveyed
through narrow passages, much out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-45" id="Pg_1-45"></a>[<a href="./images/1-45.png">45</a>]</span>
repair, until we arrived in front of a staircase
at the foot of which lay in a row, and in pairs,
shoes of all sizes, prices, and ages, patiently
waiting for their respective owners inside the
house. A great many people were outside in
the courtyard, some squatting down and smoking
a kalian, which was passed round after a puff or
two from one person to the other, care being
taken by the last smoker to wipe the mouthpiece
with the palm of his hand before handing it to
his neighbour. Others loitered about and conversed
in a low tone of voice.</p>

<p>A Mullah received me at the bottom of the
staircase and led me up stairs to a large European-looking
room, with glass windows, cane chairs,
and Austrian glass candelabras. There were a
number of Mullahs in their long black robes,
white or green sashes, and large turbans, sitting
round the room in a semicircle, and in the
centre sat the high Mullah with the young
prince by his side. They all rose when I entered,
and I was greeted in a dignified yet very
friendly manner. A chair was given me next to
the high Mullah, and the usual questions about
one's family, the vicissitudes of one's journey,
one's age, one's plans, the accounts of what one
had seen in other countries, were duly gone
through.</p>

<p>It was rather curious to notice the interest
displayed by the high Mullah in our South
African war. He seemed anxious to know
whether it was over yet, or when it would be
over. Also, how was it that a big nation like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-46" id="Pg_1-46"></a>[<a href="./images/1-46.png">46</a>]</span>
Great Britain could not conquer a small nation
like the Boers.</p>

<p>"It is easier for an elephant to kill another
elephant," I replied, "than for him to squash a
mosquito."</p>

<p>"Do you not think," said the Mullah, "that
England is now an old nation, tired and worn&mdash;too
old to fight? Nations are like individuals.
They can fight in youth&mdash;they must rest in old
age. She has lived in glory and luxury too long.
Glory and luxury make nations weak. Persia is
an example."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is much truth in your sayings.
We are tired and worn. We have been and are
still fast asleep in consequence. But maybe the
day will come when we shall wake up much
refreshed. We are old enough to learn, but not
to die yet."</p>

<p>He was sorry that England was in trouble.</p>

<p>Tea, or rather sugar with some drops of tea
on it was passed, in tiny little glasses with
miniature perforated tin spoons. Then another
cross-examination.</p>

<p>"Do you drink spirits and wine?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you smoke?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You would make a good Mussulman."</p>

<p>"Possibly, but not probably."</p>

<p>"In your travels do you find the people generally
good or bad?"</p>

<p>"Taking things all round, in their badness, I
find the people usually pretty good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-47" id="Pg_1-47"></a>[<a href="./images/1-47.png">47</a>]</span></p>

<p>"How much does your King give you to go
about seeing foreign countries?"</p>

<p>"The King gives me nothing. I go at my
own expense."</p>

<p>This statement seemed to take their breath
away. It was bad enough for a man to be
sent&mdash;for a consideration&mdash;by his own Government
to a strange land, but to pay for the
journey one's self, why! it seemed to them too
preposterous for words. They had quite an
excited discussion about it among themselves,
the Persian idea being that every man must
sponge upon the Government to the utmost
extent.</p>

<p>The young Prince hoped that I would travel
as his guest in his carriage to Teheran. Unfortunately,
however, I had made other arrangements,
and was unable to accept his invitation.</p>

<p>My visit ended with renewed salaams and good
wishes on their part for my welfare on the long
journey I was about to undertake. I noticed
that, with the exception of the Prince, who
shook my hand warmly, the Mullahs bowed
over and over again, but did not touch my hand.</p>

<p>Now for the business visit at the post station.
After a good deal of talk and an unlimited consumption
of tea, it had been arranged that a
landau with four post horses to be changed every
six farsakhs, at each post station, and a <i>fourgon</i>&mdash;a
large van without springs, also with four
horses,&mdash;for luggage, should convey me to
Teheran. So little luggage is allowed inside
one's carriage that an additional <i>fourgon</i> is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-48" id="Pg_1-48"></a>[<a href="./images/1-48.png">48</a>]</span>
nearly always required. One is told that large
packages can be forwarded at a small cost by
the postal service, and that they will reach
Teheran soon after the passengers, but unhappy
is the person that tries the rash experiment.
There is nothing to guarantee him that he will
ever see his luggage again. In Persia, a golden
rule while travelling, that may involve some loss
of time but will avoid endless trouble and worry
in the end, is never to let one's luggage go out
of sight. One is told that the new Teheran
road is a Russian enterprise, and therefore quite
reliable, and so it is, but not so the company of
transportation, which is in the hands of natives,
the firm of Messrs. Bagheroff Brothers, which
is merely subsidized by the Russian Road
Company.</p>

<p>As every one knows, in 1893 the Russians
obtained a concession to construct a carriage-road
from Piri-Bazaar <i>via</i> Resht to Kasvin, an
extension to Hamadan, and the purchase of the
road from Kasvin to Teheran, which was already
in existence. Nominally the concession was not
granted to the Russian Government itself&mdash;as is
generally believed in England&mdash;but to a private
company&mdash;the "Compagnie d'Assurance et de
Transport en Perse," which, nevertheless, is a
mere off-shoot of Government enterprise and
is backed by the Russian Government to no
mean degree. The Company's headquarters are
in Moscow, and in Persia the chief office is at
Kasvin.</p>

<p>Here it may be well to add that if this im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-49" id="Pg_1-49"></a>[<a href="./images/1-49.png">49</a>]</span>portant
concession slipped out of our hands we
have only ourselves to blame. We can in no
way accuse the Russians of taking advantage of
us, but can only admire them for knowing how
to take advantage of a good opportunity. We
had the opportunity first; it was offered us in
the first instance by Persia which needed a loan
of a paltry sixty million francs, or a little over
two million pounds sterling. The concession
was offered as a guarantee for the loan, but we,
as usual, temporised and thought it over and
argued&mdash;especially the people who did not know
what they were arguing about&mdash;and eventually
absolutely refused to have anything to do with
the scheme. The Russians had the next offer
and jumped at it, as was natural in people well
versed in Persian affairs, and well able to foresee
the enormous possibilities of such an undertaking.</p>

<p>It was, beyond doubt, from the very beginning&mdash;except
to people absolutely ignorant and
mentally blind&mdash;that the concession, apart from
its political importance, was a most excellent
financial investment. Not only would the road
be most useful for the transit of Russian goods
to the capital of Persia, and from there all over the
country, but for military purposes it would prove
invaluable. Maybe its use in the latter capacity
will be shown sooner than we in England think.</p>

<p>Of course, to complete the scheme the landing
at Enzeli must still be improved, so that small
ships may enter in safety and land passengers and
goods each journey without the unpleasant alternative,
which we have seen, of having to return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-50" id="Pg_1-50"></a>[<a href="./images/1-50.png">50</a>]</span>
to one's point of departure and begin again, two,
or three, or even four times. One gentleman I
met in Persia told me that on one occasion the
journey from Baku to Enzeli&mdash;thirty-six hours&mdash;occupied
him the space of twenty-six days!</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-05.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-05_th.jpg" alt="Fourgons on the Russian Road between Resht and Teheran." title="Fourgons on the Russian Road between Resht and Teheran." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Fourgons on the Russian Road between Resht and Teheran.</p>

<p>The Caspian is stormy the greater part of the
year, the water shallow, no protection from the
wind exists on any side, and wrecks, considering
the small amount of navigation on that sea, are
extremely frequent. As we have seen, there are
not more than six feet of water on the bar at
Enzeli, but with a jetty which could be built at
no very considerable expense (as it probably will
be some day) and a dredger kept constantly at
work, Enzeli could become quite a possible harbour,
and the dangers of long delays and the
present risks that await passengers and goods,
if not absolutely avoided, would at least be
minimised to an almost insignificant degree.
The navigation of the lagoon and stream presents
no difficulty, and the Russians have already obtained
the right to widen the mouth of the
Murd-ap at Enzeli, in conjunction with the
concession of the Piri-Bazaar-Teheran road.</p>

<p>The road was very easy to make, being mostly
over flat country and rising to no great elevation,
5,000 feet being the highest point. It follows
the old caravan track nearly all the way, the only
important detour made by the new road being
between Paichinar and Kasvin, to avoid the high
Kharzan or Kiajan pass&mdash;7,500 feet&mdash;over which
the old track went.</p>

<p>Considering the nature of the country it crosses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-51" id="Pg_1-51"></a>[<a href="./images/1-51.png">51</a>]</span>
the new road is a good one and is well kept.
Three large bridges and fifty-eight small ones
have been spanned across streams and ravines,
the longest being the bridge at Menzil, 142
yards long.</p>

<p>From Resht, <i>via</i> Deschambe Bazaar, to Kudum
the road strikes due south across country. From
Kudum (altitude, 292 feet) to Rudbar (665 feet)
the road is practically along the old track on the
north-west bank of the Kizil Uzen River, which,
from its source flows first in a south-easterly direction,
and then turns at Menzil almost at a right
angle towards the north-east, changing its name
into Sefid Rud (the White River). Some miles
after passing Rudbar, the river has to be crossed
by the great bridge, to reach Menzil, which lies
on the opposite side of the stream.</p>

<p>From Menzil to Kasvin the Russian engineers
had slightly more trouble in constructing the
road. A good deal of blasting had to be done
to make the road sufficiently broad for wheeled
traffic; then came the important detour, as we
have seen, from Paichinar to Kasvin, so that
practically the portion of the road from Menzil
to Kasvin is a new road altogether, <i>via</i> Mala Ali
and Kuhim, the old track being met again at the
village of Agha Baba.</p>

<p>The width of the road averages twenty-one
feet. In difficult places, such as along ravines,
or where the road had to be cut into the rock,
it is naturally less wide, but nowhere under fourteen
feet. The gradient averages 1&mdash;20 to 1&mdash;24.
At a very few points, however, it is as steep as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-52" id="Pg_1-52"></a>[<a href="./images/1-52.png">52</a>]</span>
1 in 15. If the hill portion of the road is excepted,
where, being in zig-zag, it has very sharp
angles, a light railway could be laid upon it in a
surprisingly short time and at no considerable
expense, the ground having been made very hard
nearly all along the road.</p>

<p>The capital of &pound;340,000 employed in the
construction of the road was subscribed in the
following manner: 1,000 shares of 1,000 rubles
each, or 1,000,000 rubles original capital subscribed
in Moscow; 1,000,000 rubles debentures
taken by the Russian Government, and a further
500,000 rubles on condition that 700,000 rubles
additional capital were subscribed, which was at
once done principally by the original shareholders.</p>

<p>The speculation had from the very beginning
a prospect of being very successful, even merely
considered as a trade route&mdash;a prospect which
the British Government, capitalist, and merchant
did not seem to grasp, but which was fully
appreciated by the quicker and more far-seeing
Russian official and trader. Any fair-minded
person cannot help admiring the Russian Government
for the insight, enterprise and sound statesmanship
with which it lost no time in supporting
the scheme (discarded by us as worthless),
and this it did, not by empty-winded, pompous
speeches and temporising promises, to which we
have so long been accustomed, but by supplying
capital in hard cash, for the double purpose of
enhancing to its fullest extent Russian trade
and of gaining the strategic advantages of such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-53" id="Pg_1-53"></a>[<a href="./images/1-53.png">53</a>]</span>
an enterprise, which are too palpable to be
referred to again.</p>

<p>So it was, that while we in England relied on
the everlasting and ever-idiotic notion that
Russia would never have the means to take up
the loan, being&mdash;as we are told&mdash;a bankrupt
country with no resources, and a Government
with no credit and no cash,&mdash;that we found
ourselves left (and laughed at), having lost an
opportunity which will never present itself again,
and which will eventually cost us the loss of
Northern Persia, if not of the whole of Persia.</p>

<p>Russia&mdash;it is only too natural&mdash;having once
set her foot, or even both feet, on Persian
soil, now tries to keep out other nations&mdash;which,
owing to her geographical position, she can do
with no effort and no trouble&mdash;in order to
enhance her youthful but solid and fast-growing
industries and trade.</p>

<p>In the case of the Teheran road, the only one,
it must be remembered, leading with any safety
to the Persian capital, it is theoretically open to
all nations. Practically, Russian goods alone
have a chance of being conveyed by this route,
owing to the prohibitive Customs duties exacted
in Russia on foreign goods in transit for Persia.
Russia is already indirectly reaping great profits
through this law, especially on machinery and
heavy goods that have no option and must be
transported by this road. There is no other way
by which they can reach Teheran on wheels.
But the chief and more direct profit of the
enterprise itself is derived from the high tolls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-54" id="Pg_1-54"></a>[<a href="./images/1-54.png">54</a>]</span>
which the Russian Company, with the authorisation
of the Persian Government, has established on
the road traffic, in order to reimburse the capital
paid out and interest to shareholders.</p>

<p>The road tolls are paid at Resht (and at intermediate
stations if travellers do not start from
Resht), and amount to 4 krans == 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for each
pack animal, whether it be a camel, a horse, a
mule, or a donkey.</p>

<p>A post-carriage with four horses (the usual
conveyance hired between Resht and Teheran)
pays a toll of no less than 17<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></p>

<p>As only 72 lbs. of personal luggage are
allowed in the landau or 65 lbs. in other
carriages, and this weight must be in small

conveyance, a <i>fourgon</i>, which can carry 650 lbs.
Every pound exceeding these weights is charged
for at the rate of two shillings for every 13&frac12; lbs.
of luggage. The luggage is weighed with
great accuracy before starting from Resht,
and on arrival in Teheran. Care is taken to
exact every half-penny to which the company
is entitled on luggage fares, and much inconvenience
and delay is caused by the Persian
officials at the scales. It is advisable for the
traveller to be present when the luggage is
weighed, to prevent fraud.</p>

<p>which is somewhat high for a journey of only
72 to 80 hours.</p>

<p>This strikes one all the more when one
compares it with the journey of several thousand
miles in the greatest of luxury from London
across Holland, Germany, Russia, and the
Caspian to Enzeli, which can be covered easily
by three five-pound notes.</p>

<p>As every one knows, the road from Piri-Bazaar
to Kasvin and Teheran was opened for
wheel traffic in January 1899.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-56" id="Pg_1-56"></a>[<a href="./images/1-56.png">56</a>]</span></p>

<p>I am told that in 1899&mdash;before the road was
completed&mdash;a Persian speculator offered the sum
of &pound;200 a day to be paid in cash every evening,
for the contract of the tolls. The offer was
most emphatically refused, as the daily tolls even
at that time amounted to between &pound;270 and
&pound;300.</p>

<p>In these last three years the road has developed
in a most astounding manner, and the receipts,
besides being now considerably greater, are
constantly increasing. The Russian shareholders
and Government can indeed fairly congratulate
themselves on the happy success which their
well-thought-out investment has fairly won

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen how the road was made.
Now let us travel on it in the hired landau
and four horses driven by a wild-looking coachman,
whose locks of jet-black hair protrude on
either side of his clean-shaven neck, and match
in colour his black astrakan, spherical, brimless
headgear. Like all good Persians, he has a
much pleated frockcoat that once was black
and is now of various shades of green. Over
it at the waist he displays a most elaborate
silver belt, and yet another belt of leather
with a profusion of cartridges stuck in it and
a revolver.</p>

<p>Why he did not run over half-a-dozen people
or more as we galloped through the narrow
streets of Resht town is incomprehensible to me,
for the outside horses almost shaved the walls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-58" id="Pg_1-58"></a>[<a href="./images/1-58.png">58</a>]</span>
on both sides, and the splash-boards of the old
landau ditto.</p>

<p>That he did not speaks volumes for the
flexibility and suppleness of Persian men,
women and children, of whom, stuck tight
against the walls in order to escape being
trampled upon or crushed to death, one got
mere glimpses, at the speed one went.</p>

<p>The corners of the streets, too, bore ample
testimony to the inaccuracy of drivers in gauging
distances, and so did the hubs and splash-boards
of the post-carriages, all twisted and staved in
by repeated collisions.</p>

<p>It is with great gusto on the part of the
drivers, but with a certain amount of alarm
on the part of the passenger, that one's carriage
chips off corner after corner of the road as one
turns them, and one gets to thank Providence
for making houses in Persia of easily-powdered
mud instead of solid stone or bricks.</p>

<p>One's heart gets lighter when we emerge
into the more sparsely inhabited districts where
fields and heavy vegetation line the road, now
very wide and more or less straight. Here the
speed is greatly increased, the coachman making
ample use of a long stock whip. In Persia
one always travels full gallop.</p>

<p>After not very long we pull up to disburse
the road toll at a wayside collecting house.
There are a great many caravans waiting,
camels, mules, donkeys, horsemen, <i>fourgons</i>,
whose owners are busy counting hard silver
krans in little piles of 10 krans each&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-59" id="Pg_1-59"></a>[<a href="./images/1-59.png">59</a>]</span>
<i>toman</i>, equivalent to a dollar,&mdash;without which
payment they cannot proceed. Post carriages
have precedence over everybody, and we are
served at once. A receipt is duly given for the
money paid, and we are off again. The coachman
is the cause of a good deal of anxiety,
for on the chance of a handsome backshish he
has indulged in copious advance libations of
rum or votka, or both, the vapours of which are
blown by the wind into my face each time that
he turns round and breathes or speaks. That
this was a case of the horses leading the coachman
and not of a man driving the horses, I have
personally not the shade of a doubt, for the
wretch, instead of minding his horses, hung
backwards, the whole way, from the high box,
yelling, I do not know what, at the top of his
voice, and making significant gestures that he
was still thirsty. Coachmen of all countries
invariably are.</p>

<p>We ran full speed into caravans of donkeys,
scattering them all over the place; we caused
flocks of frightened sheep to stampede in all
directions, and only strings of imperturbable
camels succeeded in arresting our reckless flight,
for they simply would not move out of the way.
Every now and then I snatched a furtive glance
at the scenery.</p>

<p>The moisture of the climate is so great and
the heat so intense, that the vegetation of the
whole of Ghilan province is luxuriant,&mdash;but not
picturesque, mind you. There is such a superabundance
of vegetation, the plants so crammed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-60" id="Pg_1-60"></a>[<a href="./images/1-60.png">60</a>]</span>
together, one on the top of the other, as it were,
all untidy, fat with moisture, and of such deep,
coarse, blackish-green tones that they give the
scenery a heavy leaden appearance instead of the
charming beauty of more delicate tints of less
tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>We go through Deschambe Bazaar, a place
noted for its fairs.</p>

<p>Here you have high hedges of reeds and hopelessly
entangled shrubs; there your eyes are
rested on big stretches of agriculture,&mdash;Indian
corn, endless paddy fields of rice and cotton, long
rows of mulberry trees to feed silkworms upon
their leaves. Silk is even to-day one of the
chief industries of Ghilan. Its excellent quality
was at one time the pride of the province. The
export trade of dried cocoons has been particularly
flourishing of late, and although prices
and the exchanges have fluctuated, the average
price obtained for them in Resht when fresh
was from 20&frac12; krans to 22&frac12; krans (the kran being
equivalent to about fivepence).</p>

<p>The cocoon trade had until recently been
almost entirely in the hands of Armenian, French
and Italian buyers in Resht, but now many
Persian merchants have begun to export bales of
cocoons direct to Marseilles and Milan, the two
chief markets for silk, an export duty of 5 per
cent. on their value being imposed on them by
the Persian Government. The cocoons are
made to travel by the shortest routes, <i>via</i> the
Caspian, Baku, Batum, and the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The year 1900 seems to have been an excep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-61" id="Pg_1-61"></a>[<a href="./images/1-61.png">61</a>]</span>tionally
good year for the production and export
of cocoons. The eggs for the production of
silkworms are chiefly imported by Levantines
from Asia Minor (Gimlek and Brussa), and also
in small quantities from France. According to
the report of Mr. Churchill, Acting-Consul at
Resht, the quantity of cocoons exported during
that year showed an increase of some 436,800 lbs.
above the quantity exported the previous year
(1899); and a comparison between the quantity
exported in 1893 and 1900 will show at a glance
the enormous apparent increase in the export of
dried cocoons from Ghilan.</p>

<div class='centered'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Export of cocoons">
<tr><td align='right'>1893</td><td align='right'>76,160</td><td align='left'>lbs.</td><td align='left'>Value</td><td align='right'>&pound;6,475</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>1900</td><td align='right'>1,615,488</td><td align='center'>"</td><td align='center'>"</td><td align='right'>&pound;150,265</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It must, however, be remembered that the
value given for 1893 may be very incorrect.</p>

<p>Large meadows with cattle grazing upon
them; wheat fields, vegetables of all sorts, vineyards,
all pass before my eyes as in a kaleidoscope.
A fine country indeed for farmers. Plenty of
water&mdash;even too much of it,&mdash;wood in abundance
within a stone's throw.</p>

<p>Next to the silk worms, rice must occupy our
attention, being the staple food of the natives of
Ghilan and constituting one of the principal
articles of export from that province.</p>

<p>The cultivation and the export of rice from
Ghilan have in the last thirty years become very
important, and will no doubt be more so in the
near future, when the mass of jungle and marshes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-62" id="Pg_1-62"></a>[<a href="./images/1-62.png">62</a>]</span>
will be cleared and converted into cultivable
land. The Governor-General of Resht is showing
great energy in the right direction by cutting
new roads and repairing old ones on all sides,
which ought to be of great benefit to the country.</p>

<p>In Persia, remember, it is not easy to learn
anything accurately. And as for Persian statistics,
unwise is the man who attaches any importance
to them. Much as I would like to quote
statistics, I cannot refrain from thinking that no
statistics are a hundredfold better than slip-shod,
haphazard, inaccurate ones. And this rule I
must certainly apply to the export of rice from
Ghilan to Europe, principally Russia, during
1900, and will limit myself to general remarks.</p>

<p>Extensive tracts of country have been cleared
of reeds and useless vegetation, and converted into
paddy fields, the natives irrigating the country
in a primitive fashion.</p>

<p>It is nature that is mostly responsible if the
crops are not ruined year after year, the thoughtless
inhabitants, with their natural laziness, doing
little more than praying Allah to give them
plenty of rain, instead of employing the more
practical if more laborious expedient of artificially
irrigating their country in some efficient manner,
which they could easily do from the streams
close at hand. Perhaps, in addition to this, the
fact that water&mdash;except rain-water&mdash;has ever to
be purchased in Persia, may also account to a
certain extent for the inability to afford paying
for it. In 1899, for instance, rain failed to come
and the crops were insufficient even for local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-63" id="Pg_1-63"></a>[<a href="./images/1-63.png">63</a>]</span>
consumption, which caused the population a
good deal of suffering. But 1900, fortunately,
surpassed all expectations, and was an excellent
year for rice as well as cocoons.</p>

<p>We go through thickly-wooded country, then
through a handsome forest, with wild boars
feeding peacefully a few yards from the road.
About every six farsakhs&mdash;or twenty-four
miles&mdash;the horses of the carriage, and those of
the fourgon following closely behind, are changed
at the post-stations, as well as the driver, who
leaves us, after carefully removing his saddle from
the box and the harness of the horses. He
has to ride back to his point of departure with
his horses. He expects a present of two krans,&mdash;or
more if he can get it&mdash;and so does
the driver of the fourgon. Two krans is the
recognised tip for each driver, and as one gets
some sixteen or seventeen for each vehicle,&mdash;thirty-two
or thirty-four if you have two conveyances,&mdash;between
Resht and Teheran, one
finds it quite a sufficient drain on one's
exchequer.</p>

<p>As one gets towards Kudum, where one
strikes the Sefid River, we begin to rise and the
country gets more hilly and arid. We gradually
leave behind the oppressive dampness, which
suggests miasma and fever, and begin to breathe
air which, though very hot, is drier and purer.
We have risen 262 feet at Kudum from 77 feet,
the altitude of Resht, and as we travel now in a
south-south-west direction, following the stream
upwards, we keep getting higher, the elevation at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-64" id="Pg_1-64"></a>[<a href="./images/1-64.png">64</a>]</span>
Rustamabad being already 630 feet. We leave
behind the undulating ground, covered with
thick forests, and come to barren hills, that get
more and more important as we go on. We
might almost say that the country is becoming
quite mountainous, with a few shrubs here and
there and scenery of moderate beauty, (for
any one accustomed to greater mountains), but
quite "wildly beautiful" for the ordinary traveller.
We then get to the region of the grey
olive groves, the trees with their contorted,
thickly-set branches and pointed leaves. What
becomes of the olives? They are exported to
Europe,&mdash;a flourishing trade, I am told.</p>

<p>One bumps a great deal in the carriage, for
the springs are not "of the best," and are hidden
in rope bandages to keep them from falling apart.
The road, too, is not as yet like a billiard table.
The doors of the landau rattle continuously, the
metal fastenings having long disappeared, and
being replaced by bits of string.</p>

<p>One travels incessantly, baked in the sun by
day and chilled by the cold winds at night,
trying to get a little sleep with one's head
dangling over the side of the carriage, one's legs
cramped, and all one's bones aching. But this
is preferable to stopping at any of the halting-places
on the road, whether Russian or Persian,
which are filthy beyond words, and where one is
mercilessly swindled. Should one, however, be
compelled to stop anywhere it is preferable to go
to a thoroughly Persian place, where one meets at
least with more courtesy, and where one is imposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-65" id="Pg_1-65"></a>[<a href="./images/1-65.png">65</a>]</span>
upon in a more modest and less aggressive way
than at the Russian places. It must, however,
be stated that the Russian places are usually in
charge of over-zealous Persians, or else in the
hands of inferior Russian subjects, who try to
make all they can out of their exile in the lonely
stations.</p>

<p>I occasionally halted for a glass of tea at the
Persian Khafe-Khanas, and in one of them a very
amusing incident happened, showing the serious
effects that hallucination may produce on a
weak-minded person.</p>

<p>I had got off the carriage and had carried into
the khafe-khana my camera, and also my
revolver in its leather case which had been lying
on the seat of the carriage. At my previous
halt, having neglected this precaution, my
camera had been tampered with by the natives,
the lenses had been removed, and the eighteen
plates most of them already with pictures on
them&mdash;that were inside, exposed to the light and
thrown about, with their slides, in the sand. So to
avoid a repetition of the occurrence, and to prevent
a probable accident, I brought all into the khafe-<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'kana'">khana</ins>
room and deposited the lot on the raised
mud portion along the wall, seating myself next
to my property. I ordered tea, and the attendant,
with many salaams, explained that his
fire had gone out, but that if I would wait a few
minutes he would make me some fresh <i>chah</i>. I
consented. He inquired whether the revolver
was loaded, and I said it was. He proceeded to
the further end of the room, where, turning his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-66" id="Pg_1-66"></a>[<a href="./images/1-66.png">66</a>]</span>
back to me, he began to blow upon the fire, and
I, being very thirsty, sent another man to my
fourgon to bring me a bottle of soda-water. The
imprisoned gases of the soda, which had been lying
for the whole day in the hot sun, had so expanded
that when I removed the wire the cork
went off with a loud report and unfortunately hit
the man in the shoulder blade. By association
of ideas he made so certain in his mind that it
was the revolver that had gone off that he
absolutely collapsed in a semi-faint, under the
belief that he had been badly shot. He moaned
and groaned, trying to reach with his hand what
he thought was the wounded spot, and called for
his son as he felt he was about to die. We supported
him, and gave him some water and reassured
him, but he had turned as pale as death.</p>

<p>"What have I done to you that you kill me?"
he moaned pitifully.</p>

<p>"But, good man, you have no blood flowing,&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>A languid, hopeless glance at the ground,
where he had fallen and sure enough, he could
find no blood. He tried to see the wound, but
his head could not revolve to a sufficiently wide
arc of a circle to see his shoulder-blade, so in due
haste we removed his coat and waistcoat and
shirt, and after slow, but careful, keen examination,
he discovered that not only there were
no marks of flowing blood, but no trace whatever
of a bullet hole in any of his garments. Even
then he was not certain, and two small mirrors
were sent for, which, by the aid of a sym<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-67" id="Pg_1-67"></a>[<a href="./images/1-67.png">67</a>]</span>pathising
friend, he got at proper angles minutely
to survey his whole back.</p>

<p>He eventually recovered, and was able to
proceed with the brewing of tea, which he
served with terribly trembling hand on the
rattling saucer under the tiny little glass.</p>

<p>"It was a very narrow escape from death,
sahib," he said in a wavering voice&mdash;"for it
might have been the revolver."</p>

<p>There is nothing like backshish in Persia to
heal all wounds, whether real or otherwise, and
he duly received an extra handsome one.</p>

<p>In Persia the traveller is particularly struck by
the number of Princes one encounters on the
road. This is to a certain extent to be accounted
for by the fact that the word <i>khan</i> which follows
a great many Persian names has been translated,
mainly by flattering French authors, into the
majestic but incorrect word "Prince." In many
cases the suffix of <i>khan</i> is an equivalent of Lord,
but in most cases it is no more than our nominal
"Esquire."</p>

<p>I met on the road two fellows, one old and
very dignified; the other young, and who spoke
a little French. He informed me that they were
both Princes. He called his friend "<i>Monsieur
le Prince, mon ami</i>," and himself "<i>Monsieur le
Prince, moi!</i>" which was rather amusing. He
informed me that he was a high Customs official,
and displayed towards his fellow countrymen on
the road a great many qualities that revealed a
very mean native indeed.</p>

<p>The elder one wore carpet slippers to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-68" id="Pg_1-68"></a>[<a href="./images/1-68.png">68</a>]</span>
he had attached&mdash;I do not know how&mdash;an
enormous pair of golden spurs! He was now
returning from Russia. He was extremely
gentleman-like and seemed very much annoyed
at the behaviour of his companion. He begged
me to believe that not all men in Persia were
like his friend, and I quite agreed with him.</p>

<p>We travelled a great portion of the road
together, and the old fellow was extremely civil.
He was very well informed on nearly all subjects,
and had belonged to the army. He pointed out
to me the important sights on the road, such as
Mount Janja (7,489 ft.) to the East.</p>

<p>After passing Rudbar (665 ft.) the road is
mostly in narrow gorges between mountains. It
is rocky and arid, with hardly any vegetation.
The river has to be crossed by the new bridge, a
handsome and solid structure, and we arrive at
the village of Menjil or Menzil. The Russian
station-house is the most prominent structure.
Otherwise all is desert and barren. Grey and
warm reddish tints abound in the dried-up
landscape, and only a few stunted olive groves
relieve the scenery with some vegetable life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> Menzil should be mentioned in connection
with the terrific winds which, coming
from the north-east and from the south, seem
to meet here, and blow with all their might at
all times of the year. The traveller is particularly
exposed to them directly above the river course
on crossing the bridge. Menzil is celebrated
for these winds, which are supposed to be the
worst, in all Persia, but unpleasant as they may
be to any one who has not experienced worse,
they are merely gentle breezes as compared, for
instance, with the wind storms of the Tibetan
plateau. To the east there is a very mountainous
region, the Biwarzin Yarak range, or
Kuse-rud, averaging from 6,000 to 7,000 ft.;
further north a peak of 7,850 ft., and south-west
of the Janja, 7,489 ft., the high Salambar, 11,290
ft. On the historical Mt. Alamut the old state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-70" id="Pg_1-70"></a>[<a href="./images/1-70.png">70</a>]</span>
prisons were formerly to be found, but were
afterwards removed to Ardebil.</p>

<p>From Menzil we have left the Sefid River
altogether, and we are now in a very mountainous
region, with a singular low plateau in the centre
of an extensive alluvial plain traversed by the
road. We cross the Shah Rud, or River of the
King, and at Paichinar, with its Russian post-house,
we have already reached an altitude of
1,800 ft. From this spot the road proceeds
through a narrow valley, through country rugged
and much broken up, distinctly volcanic and
quite picturesque. It is believed that coal is to
be found here.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the prettiest places we had
yet come to was Mol-Ali, a lovely shady spot
with veteran green trees all round. While the
horses were being changed I was asked by the
khafe-khana man to go and inspect a man who
was ill. The poor fellow was wrapped up in
many blankets and seemed to be suffering greatly.
He had very high fever and his was a genuine
case of smallpox. Next to him, quite unconcerned,
were a number of Persian travellers, who
had halted here for refreshments. They were
squatting on their heels, knees wide apart, and
arms balanced, resting above the elbow on their
knees&mdash;the characteristic sitting posture of all
Asiatics. Very comfortable it is, too, when
you learn to balance yourself properly and it leaves
the free use of one's arms. The <i>kalian</i> was being
passed round as usual, and each had a thimble-full
of sugared tea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-71" id="Pg_1-71"></a>[<a href="./images/1-71.png">71</a>]</span></p>

<p>I was much attracted by a large caravan of
handsome mules, the animals enjoying the
refreshing shade of the trees. They had huge
saddles ornamented with silver pommels and
rings and covered over with carpets. Variegated
cloth or carpet or red and green leather saddle-bags
hung on either side of the animals behind
the saddles. The bridle and bit were richly
ornamented with shells and silver or iron
knobs.</p>

<p>The few mud houses in the neighbourhood had
flat roofs and were not sufficiently typical nor
inviting enough for a closer internal inspection.</p>

<p>We are now on a tributary of the Shah-rud
on the new road, instead of the old caravan
track, which we have left since Paichinar.</p>

<p>The country becomes more interesting and
wild as we go on. In the undoubtedly volcanic
formation of the mountains one notices large
patches of sulphurous earth on the mountain-side,
with dark red and black baked soil above it.
Over that, all along the range, curious column-like,
fluted rocks. Lower down the soil is
saturated with sulphurous matter which gives it
a rich, dark blue tone with greenish tints in it
and bright yellow patches. The earth all round
is of a warm burnt sienna colour, intensified,
when I saw it, by the reddish, soft rays of a
dying sun. It has all the appearance of having
been subjected to abnormal heat. The
characteristic shape of the peaks of the range is
conical, and a great many deep-cut channels and
holes are noticeable in the rocky sides of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-72" id="Pg_1-72"></a>[<a href="./images/1-72.png">72</a>]</span>
sugar-loaf mountains, as is frequently the case
in mountains of volcanic formation.</p>

<p>We rise higher and higher in zig-zag <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'though'">through</ins>
rugged country, and we then go across an
intensely interesting large basin, which must
at a previous date have been the interior of an
exploded and now collapsed volcano. This
place forcibly reminded me of a similar sight on
a grander scale,&mdash;the site of the ex-Bandaisan
Mountain on the main island of Nippon in
Japan, after that enormous mountain was blown
to atoms and disappeared some few years ago.
A huge basin was left, like the bottom part of a
gigantic cauldron, the edges of which bore
ample testimony to the terrific heat that must
have been inside before the explosion took place.
In the Persian scene before us, of a much older
date, the basin, corroded as it evidently was by
substances heated to a very high temperature and
by the action of forming gases, had been to a
certain extent obliterated by the softening actions
of time and exposure to air. The impression
was not so violent and marked as the one received
at Bandaisan, which I visited only a few days
after the explosion, but the various characteristics
were similar.</p>

<p>In the basin was a solitary hut, which rejoiced
in the name of Kort. These great commotions of
nature are interesting, but to any one given to
sound reflection they are almost too big for the
human mind to grasp. They impress one, they
almost frighten one, but give no reposeful, real
pleasure in gazing upon them such as less dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-73" id="Pg_1-73"></a>[<a href="./images/1-73.png">73</a>]</span>turbed
scenery does. The contrasts in colour
and shape are too violent, too crude to please the
eye: the freaks too numerous to be comprehensible
at a glance. Here we have a ditch
with sides perfectly black-baked, evidently by
lava or some other hot substance which has
flowed through; further on big splashes of
violent red and a great variety of warm browns.
The eye roams from one spot to the other,
trying to understand exactly what has taken
place&mdash;a job which occupies a good deal of one's
time and attention as one drives through, and
which would occupy a longer time and study
than a gallop through in a post landau can
afford.</p>

<p>At Agha Baba we were again on the old track,
quite flat now, and during the night we galloped
easily on a broad road through uninteresting
country till we reached Kasvin, 185 <i>versts</i> from
Resht.</p>

<p>Kasvin, in the province of Irak, is a very
ancient city, which has seen better days, has
gone through a period of misfortune, and will in
future probably attain again a certain amount of
prosperity. It is situated at an altitude of
4,094 feet (at the Indo-European telegraph
office), an elevation which gives it a very hot
but dry, healthy climate with comparatively cool
nights. The town is handsome, square in form,
enclosed in a wall with towers.</p>

<p>The governor's palace is quite impressive,
with a fine broad avenue of green trees leading
from it to the spacious Kasvin rest-house. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-74" id="Pg_1-74"></a>[<a href="./images/1-74.png">74</a>]</span>
is by far the best rest-house on the road to the
Persian capital, with large rooms, clean enough
for Persia, and with every convenience for
cooking one's food. Above the doorway the
Persian lion, with the sun rising above his back,
has been elaborately painted, and a picturesque
pool of stagnant water at the bottom of the steps
is no doubt the breeding spot of mosquitoes and
flies, of which there are swarms, to make one's
life a misery.</p>

<p>The palatial rest-house, the governor's palace,
a mosque or two, and the convenient bath-houses
for Mahommedans being barred, there is nothing
particular to detain the traveller in Kasvin.</p>

<p>One hears that Kasvin occupied at one time a
larger area than Teheran to-day. The remains
of this magnitude are certainly still there. The
destruction of the city, they say, has been due to
many and varied misfortunes. Earthquakes and
famines in particular have played an important
part in the history of Kasvin, and they account
for the many streets and large buildings in ruins
which one finds, such as the remains of the Sufi
Palace and the domed mosque. The city dates
back to the fourth century, but it was not till
the sixteenth century that it became the <i>Dar-el-Sultanat</i>&mdash;the
seat of royalty&mdash;under Shah
Tamasp. It prospered as the royal city until
the time of Shah Abbas, whose wisdom made
him foresee the dangers of maintaining a capital
too near the Caspian Sea. Isfahan was selected
as the future capital, from which time Kasvin,
semi-abandoned, began its decline.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-75" id="Pg_1-75"></a>[<a href="./images/1-75.png">75</a>]</span></p>

<p>In 1870 a famine devastated the town to a
considerable extent, but even previous to that a
great portion of the place had been left to decay,
so that to-day one sees large stretches of ruined
houses all round the neighbourhood and in
Kasvin itself. The buildings are mostly one-storied,
very few indeed boasting of an upper
floor. The pleasant impression one receives on
entering the city is mostly caused by the quantity
of verdure and vegetation all round.</p>

<p>One of the principal things which strike the
traveller in Persia, especially on nearing a big
city, is the literal myriads of curious conical
heaps, with a pit in the centre, that one notices
running across the plains in long, interminable
rows, generally towards the mountains.
These are the <i>kanats</i>, the astounding aqueducts
with which dried-up Persia is bored in all directions
underground, the canals that lead fresh
water from the distant springs to the cities, to
the villages, and to irrigate the fields. The
ancient process of making these <i>kanats</i> has descended
unchanged to the modern Persian, who
is really a marvellous expert&mdash;when he chooses
to use his skill&mdash;at conveying water where Nature
has not provided it. I watched some men making
one of these <i>kanats</i>. They had bored a vertical
hole about three feet in diameter, over which a
wooden windlass had been erected. One man
was working at the bottom of the shaft. By
means of buckets the superfluous earth was gradually
raised up to the surface, and the hole
bored further. The earth removed in the ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-76" id="Pg_1-76"></a>[<a href="./images/1-76.png">76</a>]</span>cavation
is then embanked all round the aperture
of the shaft. When the required depth is
attained a tunnel is pierced, mostly with the
hands and a small shovel, in a horizontal direction,
and seldom less than four feet high, two feet
wide, just big enough to let the workman
through. Then another shaft has to be made
for ventilation's sake and to raise to the surface
the displaced earth. Miles of these <i>kanats</i> are
thus bored, with air shafts every ten to twenty
feet distant. In many places one sees thirty,
forty, fifty parallel long lines of these aqueducts,
with several thousand shafts, dotting the surface
of the ground.</p>

<p>Near ancient towns and villages one finds
a great many of these <i>kanats</i> dry and disused
at present, and nearly everywhere one sees
people at work making fresh ones, for how to
get water is one of the great and serious questions
in the land of Iran. Near Kasvin these
<i>kanats</i> are innumerable, and the water carried
by them goes through the streets of the city,
with holes here and there in the middle of the
road to draw it up. These holes are a serious
danger to any one given to walking about without
looking where he is placing his feet. It is
mainly due to these artificial water-tunnels that
the plain of Kasvin, otherwise arid and oppressively
hot, has been rendered extremely fertile.</p>

<p>There are a great many gardens with plenty
of fruit-trees. Vineyards abound, producing
excellent stoneless grapes, which, when dried, are
mostly exported to Russia. Pomegranates, water-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-77" id="Pg_1-77"></a>[<a href="./images/1-77.png">77</a>]</span>melons,
cucumbers, and cotton are also grown.
Excellent horses and camels are bred here.</p>

<p>Kasvin being the half-way house, as it were,
between Resht and Teheran, and an important
city in itself, is bound&mdash;even if only in a reflected
manner&mdash;to feel the good effects of having
through communication to the Caspian and the
capital made so easy by the completion of the
Russian road.</p>

<p>The silk and rice export trade for Bagdad has
gone up during the last two years, and in the
fertile plain in which Kasvin lies agriculture is
beginning to look up again, although not quite
so much as in the Resht district, which is
naturally the first to reap benefit from the
development of Northern Persia.</p>

<p>The chief manufactures of Kasvin are carpets,
a kind of coarse cotton-cloth called <i>kerbas</i>, velvet,
brocades, iron-ware and sword-blades, which are
much appreciated by Persians.</p>

<p>There is a large bazaar in which many cheap
European goods are sold besides the more
picturesque articles of local manufacture.</p>

<p>From a strategical point of view, Kasvin
occupies a position not to be overlooked, guarding
as it does the principal entrance from the
south into the Ghilan province.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> hours' rest to give one's aching bones
a chance of returning into their normal condition
and position, and amidst the profound salaams of
the rest-house servants, we speed away towards
Teheran, 130 versts more according to the
Russian road measurement (about 108 miles).
We gallop on the old, wide and flat road, on
which the traffic alone diverts one,&mdash;long strings
of donkeys, of camels, every now and then a
splendid horse with a swaggering rider. We are
travelling on the top of the plateau, and are
keeping at an altitude slightly above 4,000 feet.
Distant mountains lie to the north, otherwise
there is absolutely nothing to see, no vegetation
worth mentioning, everything dry and barren.</p>

<p>Now and then, miles and miles apart, comes
a quadrangular or rectangular, castellated mud
wall enclosing a cluster of fruit trees and vege<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-79" id="Pg_1-79"></a>[<a href="./images/1-79.png">79</a>]</span>table
gardens; then miles and miles again of
dreary, barren country.</p>

<p>Were it not for the impudence of the natives&mdash;increasing
to a maximum&mdash;there is nothing to
warn the traveller that one is approaching the
capital of the Persian Empire, and one finds
one's self at the gate of the city without the usual
excitement of perceiving from a distance a high
tower, or a dome or a steeple or a fortress, or a
landmark of some sort or other, to make one
enjoy the approach of one's journey's end.</p>

<p>Abdulabad, 4,015 feet, Kishslak, 3,950 feet,
Sankarabad, 4,210 feet, Sulimaneh, 4,520 feet,
are the principal places and main elevations on
the road, but from the last-named place the
incline in the plateau tends to descend very
gently. Teheran is at an altitude of 3,865 feet.</p>

<p>Six farsakhs from Teheran, where we had to
change horses, an individual connected with the
transport company made himself very obnoxious,
and insisted on accompanying the carriage to
Teheran. He was picturesquely attired in a
brown long coat, and displayed a nickel-plated
revolver, with a leather belt of cartridges. He
was cruel to the horses and a nuisance to the
coachman. He interfered considerably with the
progress of the carriage and made himself unbearable
in every possible way. When I stopped
at a khafe-khana for a glass of tea, he actually
removed a wheel of the carriage, which we had
considerable difficulty in putting right again, and
he pounded the coachman on the head with the
butt of his revolver, in order, as far as I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-80" id="Pg_1-80"></a>[<a href="./images/1-80.png">80</a>]</span>
understand, that he should be induced to go half-shares
with him in the backshish that the driver
would receive at the end of the stage.</p>

<p>All this provided some entertainment, until
we reached the Teheran gate. Only half a mile
more and I should be at the hotel. But man
proposes and the Persian disposes. The carriage
and fourgon were driven into a large courtyard,
the horses were unharnessed, all the luggage
removed from the fourgon and carriage, and
deposited in the dust. A primitive scale was
produced and slung to a tripod, and each article
weighed and weighed over again so as to take up
as much of one's time as possible. Various
expedients to impose upon me, having failed
I was allowed to proceed, a new fourgon and
fresh horses being provided for the journey of
half a mile more, the obnoxious man jumping
first on the box so as to prevent being left
behind.</p>

<p>At last the hotel was reached, and here
another row arose with a profusion of blows
among a crowd of beggars who had at once
collected and disputed among themselves the
right of unloading my luggage.</p>

<p>A strange figure appeared on the scene. A
powerful, half-naked African, as black as coal,
and no less than six foot two in height. He
sported a huge wooden club in his hand, which
he whirled round in a most dangerous manner,
occasionally landing it on people's skulls and
backs in a sonorous fashion. The crowd
vanished, and he, now as gently as possible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-81" id="Pg_1-81"></a>[<a href="./images/1-81.png">81</a>]</span>
removed the luggage from the fourgon and
conveyed it into the hotel.</p>

<p>The obnoxious man now hastily descended
from his seat and demanded a backshish.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," intervened a Persian gentleman
present, "this man says he has annoyed you all
the way, but he could not make you angry. He
must have backshish! He makes a living by
annoying travellers!"</p>

<p>In contrast to this low, depraved parasite, the
African black seemed quite a striking figure,&mdash;a
scamp, if you like, yet full of character. He
was a dervish, with drunken habits and a fierce
nature when under the influence of drink, but
with many good points when sober. On one
occasion an Englishman was attacked by a crowd
of Persians, and was in danger of losing his life,
when this man, with considerable bravery (not
to speak of his inseparable mallet which he used
freely), went to the rescue of the sahib and
succeeded in saving him. For this act of
courage he has ever since been supported by the
charity of foreigners in Teheran. He unfortunately
spends all his earnings in drink, and
can be very coarse indeed, in his songs and
imitations, which he delights in giving when
under the influence of liquor. He hangs round
the hotel, crying out "<i>Yahu! yahu!</i>" when
hungry&mdash;a cry quite pathetic and weird, especially
in the stillness of night.</p>

<p>There are two hotels in Teheran and several
European and Armenian restaurants. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-82" id="Pg_1-82"></a>[<a href="./images/1-82.png">82</a>]</span>
English hotel is the best,&mdash;not a dream of cleanliness,
nor luxury, nor boasting of a cuisine
which would remain impressed upon one's mind,
except for its elaborate monotony,&mdash;but quite a
comfortable place by comparison with the other
European hotels of Persia. The beds are clean,
and the proprietress tries hard to make people
comfortable.</p>

<p>More interesting than the hotel itself was the
curious crowd of people whom one saw at the
dinner-table. I remember sitting down one
evening to dinner with nine other people, and
we represented no less than ten different
nationalities! The tower of Babel sank almost
into insignificance compared with the variety
of languages one heard spoken all round, and
one's polyglot abilities were tested to no mean
extent in trying to carry on a general conversation.
One pleasant feature of these dinners
was the amount of talent and good-humour
that prevailed in the company, and the absolute
lack of distinction of class or social position.
Side by side one saw a distinguished
diplomat conversing with the Shah's automobile
driver, and a noteworthy English member of
Parliament on friendly terms with an Irish
gentleman of the Indo-European Telegraphs.
A burly, jolly Dutchman stood drinks all round
to members of the Russian and English Banks
alike, and a French <i>sage-femme</i> just arrived
discussed her prospects with the hotel proprietress.
The Shah's A.D.C. and favourite
music-composer and pianist came frequently to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-83" id="Pg_1-83"></a>[<a href="./images/1-83.png">83</a>]</span>
enliven the evenings with some really magnificent
playing, and by way of diversion some wild
Belgian employees of the derelict sugar-factory
used almost nightly to cover with insults a
notable "Chevalier d'industrie" whose thick
skin was amazing.</p>

<p>Then one met Armenians&mdash;who one was told
had come out of jail,&mdash;and curio-dealers, mine
prospectors, and foreign Generals of the Persian
army.</p>

<p>Occasionally there was extra excitement when
an engagement or a wedding took place, when the
parties usually adjourned to the hotel, and then
there was unlimited consumption of beer,
nominally (glycerine really, for, let me explain,
beer does not stand a hot climate unless a large
percentage of glycerine is added to it), and of
highly-explosive champagne and French wines,
Ch&acirc;teau this and Ch&acirc;teau that&mdash;of Caspian
origin.</p>

<p>Being almost a teetotaller myself, this mixed
crowd&mdash;but not the mixed drink&mdash;was interesting
to study, and what particularly struck me
was the <i>bonhomie</i>, the real good-heartedness, and
manly but thoughtful, genial friendliness of men
towards one another, irrespective of class, position
or condition, except, of course, in the cases of
people with whom it was not possible to associate.
The hard, mean, almost brutal jealousy, spite, the
petty rancour of the usual Anglo-Indian man, for
instance, does not exist at all in Persia among
foreigners or English people. On the contrary,
it is impossible to find more hospitable, more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-84" id="Pg_1-84"></a>[<a href="./images/1-84.png">84</a>]</span>
gentlemanly, polite, open-minded folks than the
Britishers one meets in Persia.</p>

<p>Of course, it must be remembered, the type of
Britisher one finds in Persia is a specially
talented, enterprising and well-to-do individual,
whose ideas have been greatly broadened by the
study of several foreign languages which, in
many cases, have taken him on the Continent for
several years in his youth. Furthermore, lacking
entirely the ruling "look down upon the native"
idea, so prevalent in India, he is thrown much in
contact with the Persians, adopting from them
the courteous manner and form of speech, which
is certainly more pleasant than the absurd rudeness
of the "keep-aloof" notion which generally
makes us hated by most Orientals.</p>

<p>The Britisher in Persia, with few exceptions,
is a charming person, simple and unaffected, and
ready to be of service if he can. He is not
aggressive, and, in fact, surprisingly suave.</p>

<p>This abnormal feature in the British character
is partly due to the climate, hot but very
healthy, and to the exile to which the Briton
has to reconcile himself for years to come.
Indeed, Persia is an exile, a painful one for a
bachelor, particularly. Woman's society, which
at all times helps to make life sweet and pleasant,
is absolutely lacking in Persia. European women
are scarce and mostly married or about to get
married. The native women are kept in strict
seclusion. One never sees a native woman
except heavily veiled under her <i>chudder</i>, much
less can a European talk to her. The laws<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-85" id="Pg_1-85"></a>[<a href="./images/1-85.png">85</a>]</span>
of Persia are so severe that anything in the
shape of a flirtation with a Persian lady may cost
the life of Juliet or Romeo, or both, and if life
is spared, blackmail is ever after levied by the
police or by the girl's parents or by servants.</p>

<p>In Teheran all good citizens must be indoors
by nine o'clock at night, and any one found
prowling in the streets after that hour has to deal
with the police. In the European quarter this
rule is overlooked in the case of foreigners, but
in the native city even Europeans found peacefully
walking about later than that hour are
taken into custody and conveyed before the
magistrate, who satisfies himself as to the man's
identity and has him duly escorted home.</p>

<p>There are no permanent amusements of any
kind in Teheran. An occasional concert or a
dance, but no theatres, no music-halls. There
is a comfortable Club, where people meet and
drink and play cards, but that is all.</p>

<p>Social sets, of course, exist in the Teheran
foreign community. There are "The Telegraph"
set, "the Bank," "the Legations."
There is an uncommon deal of social etiquette,
and people are most particular regarding calls,
dress, and the number of cards left at each door.
It looks somewhat incongruous to see men
in their black frock-coats and silk tall hats,
prowling about the streets, with mud up to their
knees if wet, or blinded with dust if dry, among
strings of camels, mules, or donkeys. But that
is the fashion, and people have to abide by it.</p>

<p>There are missionaries in Teheran, American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-86" id="Pg_1-86"></a>[<a href="./images/1-86.png">86</a>]</span>
and English, but fortunately they are not permitted
to make converts. The English, Russian
and Belgian communities are the most numerous,
then the French, the Dutch, the Austrian, the
Italian, the American.</p>

<p>Taking things all round, the Europeans seem
reconciled to their position in Teheran&mdash;a life
devoid of any very great excitement, and partaking
rather of the nature of vegetation, yet
with a certain charm in it&mdash;they say&mdash;when
once people get accustomed to it. But one has
to get accustomed to it first.</p>

<p>The usual servant question is a very serious
one in Teheran, and is one of the chief troubles
that Europeans have to contend with. There
are Armenian and Persian servants, and there is
little to choose between the two. Servants
accustomed to European ways are usually a bad
lot, and most unreliable; but in all fairness it
must be admitted that, to a great extent, these
servants have been utterly spoilt by Europeans
themselves, who did not know how to deal with
them in a suitable manner. I repeatedly noticed
in Teheran and other parts of Persia that people
who really understood the Persian character, and
treated subordinates with consideration, had most
excellent servants&mdash;to my mind, the most intelligent
and hard-working in the world&mdash;and
spoke very highly of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A description</span> of Teheran is hardly necessary
here, the city being so well-known, but
for the help of people unfamiliar with its
character a rough sketch of the place may be
given.</p>

<p>Teheran, it must be remembered, has only
been the capital of Persia for the last hundred
years, when the capital was removed from
Isfahan. Previous to that it was merely a
royal resort and nothing more. In shape it
was formerly almost circular&mdash;or, to be strictly
accurate, polygonal, the periphery of the polygon
measuring a <i>farsakh</i>, four miles. Like all
Persian cities it was enclosed in a mud wall
and a moat. Since then the city has so
increased that an extension has been made to
an outer boundary some ten miles in circumference,
and marked by an uneven ditch, the
excavated sand of which is thrown up to form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-88" id="Pg_1-88"></a>[<a href="./images/1-88.png">88</a>]</span>
a sort of battlement. Twelve gates, opened at
sunrise and closed at night, give access to the
town. The citadel, the ancient part of the city,
contains the principal public buildings, the
private residences of high officials, and the
Shah's Palace. To the south of this are found
the extensive domed bazaars and the commercial
portion of Teheran. To the north lies
the European quarter with the Legations,
Banks and European shops.</p>

<p>We will not go as far back as the Afghan
invasion in 1728 when, according to history,
Teheran was looted and razed to the ground by
the Afghans, but we will only mention the fact,
which is more interesting to us, that it was not
till about 1788 that the city was selected on
account of its geographical position and of
political necessities, as the seat of the Kajar
dynasty by Agha Mohammed, who in 1796
became the first King of his family. The
Kajar, as everybody knows, has remained the
reigning dynasty of Persia to this day.</p>

<p>The most interesting point of Teheran, in
the very centre of the city, is the old "Place
du Canon," where on a high platform is a
gigantic piece of ordnance enclosed by a railing.
In the same square is a large reservoir of more
or less limpid water, in which at all hours of the
day dozens of people are to be seen bathing.
But the big gun attracts one's attention principally.
A curious custom, which is slowly being
done away with, has made this spot a sanctuary.
Whoever remains within touch or even within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-89" id="Pg_1-89"></a>[<a href="./images/1-89.png">89</a>]</span>
the shadow of the gun&mdash;whether an assassin, a
thief, a bankrupt, an incendiary, a traitor or a
highwayman,&mdash;in fact, a criminal of any kind
cannot be touched by the police nor by persons
seeking a personal revenge&mdash;the usual way of
settling differences in Persia. A number of
distinctly criminal types can always be observed
near the gun and are fed by relations, friends,
or by charitable people. Persians of all classes
are extremely charitable, not so much for the
sake of helping their neighbours in distress, as
for increasing their claims to a seat in Paradise,
according to the Mussulman religion.</p>

<p>These sanctuaries are common in Persia. The
mosques, the principal shrines, such as Meshed,
Kum, the houses of Mullahs, and in many
cases the bazaars which are generally to be found
adjoining places of pilgrimage, afford most
convenient shelter to outlaws. The Mullahs
are greatly responsible for the protection of
miscreants. By exercising it they are able to
show their power over the authorities of the
country&mdash;a fact which impresses the masses.
That is why in the neighbourhood of many
mosques one sees a great number of ruffianly
faces, unmistakable cut-throats, men and boys
whose villainy is plainly stamped on their countenances.
As long as they remain inside the
sacred precincts&mdash;which they can do if they like
till they die of old age&mdash;they can laugh at the
law and at the world at large. But let them
come out, and they are done for.</p>

<p>The Shah's stables are considered a very safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-90" id="Pg_1-90"></a>[<a href="./images/1-90.png">90</a>]</span>
sanctuary. Houses of Europeans, or Europeans
themselves, were formerly considered sanctuaries,
but the habit has&mdash;fortunately for the
residents&mdash;fallen into disuse. I myself, when
driving one day in the environs of Teheran, saw
a horseman leading a man whose neck was tied
to a substantial rope. Much to my surprise,
when near enough, the prisoner jumped into my
carriage, and it was only after some persuasion
on my side and a few pulls at the rope from the
rider at the other end that the unwelcome
companion was made to dismount again.</p>

<p class="illc">The Murderer of Nasr-ed-din Shah.</p>

<p>When in the company of high Mullahs evil
characters are also inviolable.</p>

<p>The largest square in Teheran is the Top
Meidan or "Cannon plain," where several small
and antiquated pieces of artillery are enclosed in
a fence. Two parallel avenues with trees cross
the rectangular square at its longest side from
north to south. In the centre is a large covered
reservoir. The offices of both the Persian and
Indo-European Telegraphs are in this square,
and also the very handsome building of the Bank
of Persia.</p>

<p>The square is quite imposing at first sight,
having on two sides uniform buildings with long
balconies. The <i>lunettes</i> of the archways underneath
have each a picture of a gun, and on
approaching the southern gates of the parallelogram
a smile is provoked by the gigantic but
crude, almost childish representations of modern
soldiers on glazed tiles. To the west is the
extensive drill ground for the Persian troops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-91" id="Pg_1-91"></a>[<a href="./images/1-91.png">91</a>]</span>
Another important artery of Teheran runs from
east to west across the same square.</p>

<p>One cannot but be interested on perceiving
along the main thoroughfares of Teheran a service
of horse tramways working quite steadily.
But the rolling stock is not particularly inviting
outwardly&mdash;much less inwardly. It is mostly
for the use of natives and Armenians, and the
carriages are very dirty. The horses, however,
are good. The Tramway Company in the hands
of Russian Jews, I believe, but managed by an
Englishman and various foreigners&mdash;subalterns&mdash;was
doing pretty fair business, and jointly with
the tramways had established a capital service of
"Voitures de remise," which avoided all the
trouble and unpleasantness of employing street
cabs. The carriages, mostly victorias, were
quite good and clean.</p>

<p>Among other foreign things, Teheran can also
boast of a railway&mdash;a mere steam tramway, in
reality&mdash;of very narrow gauge and extending for
some six miles south of the city to the shrine of
Shah Abdul Hazim.</p>

<p>The construction of even so short and unimportant
a line met with a great deal of
opposition, especially from the priestly class,
when it was first started in 1886 by a Belgian
company&mdash;"La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Chemins de Fer et
des Tramways de Perse." The trains began to
run two years later, in 1888, and it was believed
that the enormous crowds of pilgrims who daily
visited the holy shrine would avail themselves of
the convenience. Huge profits were expected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-92" id="Pg_1-92"></a>[<a href="./images/1-92.png">92</a>]</span>
but unluckily the four or five engines that were
imported at an excessive cost, and the difficulties
encountered in laying down the line, which was
continually being torn up by fanatics, and, most
of all, the difficulty experienced in inducing
pilgrims to travel in sufficient numbers by the
line instead of on horses, mules or donkeys were
unexpected and insoluble problems which the
managers had to face, and which made the
shareholders grumble. The expenses far exceeded
the profits, and the capital employed in
the construction of the line was already vastly
larger than had been anticipated. One fine day,
furthermore, a much-envied and respected pilgrim,
who had returned in holiness from the famous
shrine of Kerbalah, was unhappily run over and
killed by a train. The Mullahs made capital of
this accident and preached vengeance upon
foreign importations, the work of the devil and
distasteful to Allah the great. The railway was
mobbed and the engine and carriages became a
mass of d&eacute;bris.</p>

<p>There was nearly a serious riot about this in
Teheran city; the trains continued to run with
the undamaged engines, but no one would travel
by them. Result? "La Compagnie des Chemins
de Fer et des Tramways de Perse" went bankrupt.
The whole concern was eventually bought
up cheap by a Russian Company, and is now
working again, as far as regards the railway, in a
more or less spasmodic manner.</p>

<p>The tramway service connects the three
principal gates of the outer wall of Teheran with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-93" id="Pg_1-93"></a>[<a href="./images/1-93.png">93</a>]</span>
the centre of the city "the Place des Canons"
(Meidan-Top-Khaned).</p>

<p>Although there are a great many mosques in
Teheran city there is not one of great importance
or beauty. The Mesjid-i-shah, or the Shah's
Mosque, is the most noteworthy, and has a very
decorative glazed tiled fa&ccedil;ade. Then next in
beauty is probably the mosque of the Shah's
mother, but neither is in any way uncommon
for size, or wealth, architectural lines, or sacredness.
Several mosques have colleges attached to
them, as is the usual custom in Persia. Access
to the interior of the mosques is not permitted
to Europeans unless they have embraced the
Mahommedan religion.</p>

<p>Outwardly, there are few native houses in
Teheran that impress one with any remarkable
features of wealth or beauty; in fact, they are
nearly all wretchedly miserable,&mdash;a plastered
mud or brick wall with a modest little doorway
being all one sees from the street of the dwellings
of even the richest and noblest of Persians.
Inside matters are different. Frequently a miserable
little tumbling-down gate gives access,
after going through similarly miserable, narrow,
low passages, to magnificent palaces and astoundingly
beautiful and luxurious courts and gardens.
I asked what was the reason of the poor outward
appearance of these otherwise luxurious
dwellings. Was it modesty,&mdash;was it to deceive
envious eyes?</p>

<p>There are few countries where blackmail and
extortion are carried on on a more extensive and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-94" id="Pg_1-94"></a>[<a href="./images/1-94.png">94</a>]</span>
successful scale than in Persia; all classes and
conditions of people are exposed to the danger,
and it is only by an assumed air of poverty that
a certain amount of security is obtained. A
miserable-looking house, it was explained by a
Persian, does not attract the covetous eye of the
passer-by; an unusually beautiful one does.
"It is a fatal mistake," he added, "to let anybody's
eye rest on one's possessions, whether he
be the Shah, a minister, or a beggar. He will
want to rest his hands upon them next, and then
everything is gone. Besides," he said, "it is the
inside of a house that gives pleasure and comfort
to the occupier and his friends. One does not
build a house to give pleasure and comfort to
the people in the street. That is only vainglory
of persons who wish to make their neighbours
jealous by outward show. They usually have to
repent it sooner or later."</p>

<p>There was more philosophy than European
minds may conceive in the Persian's words&mdash;at
least, for Persian householders.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Legations&mdash;Germany a stumbling-block to Russia's and England's
supremacy&mdash;Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister
in Teheran&mdash;His talent, tact, and popularity&mdash;The British
Legation&mdash;Summer quarters&mdash;Legation guards&mdash;Removal
of furniture.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> late as 1872 there were only four Legations
in Teheran: the English, French, Russian and
Turkish; but since then the Governments of
Austria, Belgium, Holland, and the United
States have established Legations in the Persian
capital. By the Persians themselves only four
are considered of first-class importance, viz.: the
British, Russian, Turkish and Belgian Legations,
as being more closely allied with the interests of
the country. The Austrian Legation comes
next to these in importance, then the German.</p>

<p>American interests are so far almost a negligible
quantity in Persia, but Germany is
attempting to force her trade into Persia. In
future, if she can realise her railway schemes in
Asia Minor, Germany will be a very serious
stumbling-block to England's and Russia's
supremacy, both in North and Southern Persia.
Germany's representative in Teheran is a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-96" id="Pg_1-96"></a>[<a href="./images/1-96.png">96</a>]</span>
of considerable skill and untiring energy. No
doubt that when the opportune time comes and
Germany is ready to advance commercially in
the Persian market, England in particular will
be the chief sufferer, as the British manufacturer
has already experienced great difficulty in contending
with the cheap German goods. Even
in India, where transport is comparatively easy,
German goods swamp the bazaars in preference
to English goods. Much more will this be the
case in Persia when the railway comes to the
Persian boundary.</p>

<p>The German Minister is certainly sparing no
efforts to foster German interests in Persia, and
the enterprising Emperor William has shown
every possible attention to the Shah on his visit
to Berlin, in order that the racial antipathy,
which for some reason or other Persians entertain
towards Germans, may with all due speed
be wiped out.</p>

<p>To us the British Legation is more interesting
at present. We may well be proud of our
present Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, a man of
whose like we have few in our diplomatic
service. I do not think that a man more fit for
Persia than Sir Arthur could be found anywhere
in the British Empire. He possesses quite
extraordinary talent, with a quick working
brain, a marvellous aptitude for languages&mdash;in a
few months' residence in Persia he had mastered
the Persian language, and is able to converse in
it fluently&mdash;and is endowed with a gift which
few Britishers possess, refined tact and a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-97" id="Pg_1-97"></a>[<a href="./images/1-97.png">97</a>]</span>
amount of thoughtful consideration for other
people's feelings.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Sir Arthur seems to understand
Orientals thoroughly, and Persians in
particular. He is extremely dignified in his
demeanour towards the native officials, yet he is
most affable and cheery, with a very taking,
charming manner. That goes a much longer
way in Persia than the other unfortunate manner
by which many of our officials think to show
dignity&mdash;sheer stiffness, rudeness, bluntness,
clumsiness&mdash;which offends, offends bitterly, instead
of impressing.</p>

<p>A fluent and most graceful speaker, with a
strong touch of Oriental flowery forms of speech
in his compliments to officials, with an eye that
accurately gauges situations&mdash;usually in Persia
very difficult ones&mdash;a man full of resource and
absolutely devoid of ridiculous insular notions&mdash;a
man who studies hard and works harder still&mdash;a
man with unbounded energy and an enthusiast
in his work&mdash;a man who knows his subject well,
although he has been such a short time in
Teheran&mdash;this is our British Minister at the
Shah's Court.</p>

<p>Nor is this faint praise. Sir Arthur Hardinge
has done more in a few months to save British
prestige and to safeguard British interests in
Persia than the public know, and this he has
done merely by his own personal genius and
charm, rather than by instructions or help from
the home Government.</p>

<p>While in Teheran I had much opportunity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-98" id="Pg_1-98"></a>[<a href="./images/1-98.png">98</a>]</span>
meeting a great many high Persian officials, and
all were unanimous in singing the praises of our
new Minister. Many of them seemed very
bitter against some of his predecessors, but
whether the fault was in the predecessors themselves
or in the home Government, it is not for
me to say. Anyhow, bygones are bygones, and
we must make the best of our present opportunities.
The staff at our Legation and Consulate
is also first-class.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped, now that the South African
war is over, that the Government will be able to
devote more attention to the Persian Question, a
far more serious matter than we imagine; and as
extreme ignorance prevails in this country
about Persia&mdash;even in circles where it should
not exist&mdash;it would be well, when we have such
excellent men as Sir Arthur Hardinge at the
helm, in whose intelligence we may confidently
and absolutely trust, to give him a little more
assistance and freedom of action, so as to allow
him a chance of safeguarding our interests
properly, and possibly of preventing further
disasters.</p>

<p>It is not easy for the uninitiated to realise the
value of certain concessions obtained for the
British by Sir Arthur Hardinge, such as, for
instance, the new land telegraph line <i>via</i> Kerman
Beluchistan to India. Of the petroleum concessions,
of which one hears a great deal of late,
I would prefer not to speak.</p>

<p>The Legation grounds in Teheran itself are
extensive and beautiful, with a great many fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-99" id="Pg_1-99"></a>[<a href="./images/1-99.png">99</a>]</span>
trees and shady, cool avenues. The Legation
house is handsomely furnished, and dotted all
over the gardens are the various other buildings
for secretaries, attach&eacute;s, and interpreters. All
the structures are of European architecture&mdash;simple,
but solid. In summer, however, all the
Legations shift their quarters to what is called in
Teheran "<i>la campagne de</i> Golahek, de Tejerish,
de Zargandeh,"&mdash;by which gracefully misleading
and misapplied terms are indicated the
suburban residences of the Legations, at the
foot of the arid, barren, hot, dusty Shamran
range of mountains.</p>

<p>Golahek, where the British Legation is to be
found, does actually boast of a few green trees
in the Legation grounds; and a cluster or two of
nominally "green" vegetation&mdash;really whitish
brown&mdash;can be seen at Zargandeh, where the
Russian and Belgian Legations are side by side,
and Tejerish, where the Persian Foreign Office
and many Persian officials have their summer
residences.</p>

<p>The drive from Teheran to Golahek&mdash;seven
miles&mdash;is dusty beyond words. There are
wretched-looking trees here and there along the
road, so dried and white with dust as to excite
compassion. Half-way to Golahek the monotony
of the journey is broken by a sudden halt
at a khafe-khana, into which the coachman
rushes, leaving the horses to take care of themselves,
while he sips refreshing glasses of tea.
When it suits his convenience he returns to
splash buckets of water between the horses' legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-100" id="Pg_1-100"></a>[<a href="./images/1-100.png">100</a>]</span>
and under their tails. This, he told me, in all
seriousness, was to prevent sunstroke (really, the
Persian can be humorous without knowing it),
and was a preventive imported with civilised
ways from Europe! The ears and manes of the
animals are then pulled violently, after which
the horses are considered able to proceed.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-08.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-08_th.jpg" alt="Persian Cossacks (Teheran) Drilled by Russian Officers." title="Persian Cossacks (Teheran) Drilled by Russian Officers." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Persian Cossacks (Teheran) Drilled by Russian Officers.</p>

<p>The Persian Government gives each Legation
a guard of soldiers. The British Legation is
guarded by infantry soldiers&mdash;an untidy, ragged,
undisciplined lot, with cylindrical hats worn at
all angles on the side of the head, and with
uniforms so dirty and torn that it is difficult to
discern what they should be like. Nearly all
other Legations are provided with soldiers of the
(Persian) Cossack regiment, who are infinitely
better drilled and clothed than the infantry regiments.
They are quite military in appearance.
It was believed that these Cossacks, being drilled
by Russian military instructors, would not be
acceptable at the British Legation, hence the
guard of infantry soldiers.</p>

<p>The Russian Legation has two additional
Russian cavalry soldiers.</p>

<p>The country residences of all the Legations
are quite comfortable, pretty and unpretentious,
with the usual complement of furniture of folding
pattern, so convenient but so inartistic, and
a superabundance of cane chairs. Really good
furniture being very expensive in Teheran, a
good deal of the upholstery of the Teheran Legations
is conveyed to the country residences for
the summer months. Perhaps nothing is more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-101" id="Pg_1-101"></a>[<a href="./images/1-101.png">101</a>]</span>
amusing to watch than one of these removals to
or from the country. Chairs, tables, sofas, and
most private effects are tied to pack-saddles on
ponies, mules or donkeys, with bundles of
mattrasses, blankets, and linen piled anyhow
upon them, while the more brittle articles of the
household are all amassed into a high pyramid
on a gigantic tray and balanced on a man's
head. Rows of these equilibrists, with the most
precious glass and crockery of the homestead,
can be noticed toddling along on the Golahek
road, dodging carriages and cavaliers in a most
surprising manner. They are said never to
break even the smallest and most fragile articles,
but such is certainly not the case with the
heavily laden donkeys and mules, which often
collide or collapse altogether, with most disastrous
results to the heavier pieces of furniture.</p>

<p>On my arrival in Teheran I received a most
charming invitation to go and stay at the British
Legation, but partly owing to the fact that I
wished to remain in town and so be more in
touch with the natives themselves, partly because
I wished to be unbiassed in any opinion that I
might form, I decided not to accept anybody's
hospitality while in Teheran. This I am very
glad I did, for I feel I can now express an
opinion which, whether right or wrong, is my
own, and has not been in any way influenced by
any one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the description of one or two visits to
high Persian officials may interest the reader.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of the Persian Legation
in London I had received letters of introduction
which I forwarded to their addresses on my
arrival in Teheran. The first to answer, a few
hours after I had reached Teheran, was Meftah-es-Sultaneh
(Davoud), the highest person in the
Foreign Office after the Minister, who in a most
polite letter begged me to go to tea with him
at once. He had just come to town from
Tejerish, but would leave again the same
evening.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-09.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-09_th.jpg" alt="The Eftetahi&eacute; College, supported by Meftah-el-Mulk." title="The Eftetahi&eacute; College, supported by Meftah-el-Mulk." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The Eftetahi&eacute; College</span>, supported by Meftah-el-Mulk.</p>

<p>Escorted by the messenger, I at once drove to
Meftah's Palace, outwardly, like other palaces,
of extremely modest appearance, and entered by
a small doorway leading through very narrow
passages. Led by my guide, we suddenly passed
through a most quaint court, beautifully clean
and with a pretty fountain in the centre,&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-103" id="Pg_1-103"></a>[<a href="./images/1-103.png">103</a>]</span>
no time was given me to rest and admire.
Again we entered another dark passage, this
time to emerge into a most beautiful garden with
rare plants and lovely flowers, with a huge tank,
fountains playing and swans floating gracefully
on the water. A most beautiful palace in
European architecture of good taste faced the
garden.</p>

<p>I was admitted into a spacious drawing-room,
furnished in good European style, where Meftah-es-Sultaneh&mdash;a
rotund and jovial gentleman&mdash;greeted
me with effusion. Although he had
never been out of Persia, he spoke French,
with a most perfect accent, as fluently as a
Frenchman.</p>

<p>What particularly struck me in him, and,
later, in many other of the younger generation
of the upper classes in Persia, was the happy
mixture of the utmost charm of manner with a
keen business head, delightful tact and no mean
sense of humour. Meftah-es-Sultaneh, for instance,
spoke most interestingly for over an hour,
and I was agreeably surprised to find what an
excellent foreign education students can receive
without leaving Persia. It is true that Meftah
is an exceptionally clever man, who would make
his mark anywhere; still it was nevertheless
remarkable how well informed he was on matters
not concerning his country.</p>

<p>He comes from a good stock. His father,
Meftah-el-Mulk, was Minister member of the
Council of State, a very wealthy man, who
devoted much of his time and money to doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-104" id="Pg_1-104"></a>[<a href="./images/1-104.png">104</a>]</span>
good to his country. Among the many praiseworthy
institutions founded and entirely supported
by him was the college for orphans, the
Dabetsane Daneshe, and the Eftetahi&eacute; School.
The colleges occupy beautiful premises, and first-rate
teachers are provided who instruct their
pupils in sensible, useful matters. The boys are
well fed and clothed and are made quite happy
in every way.</p>

<p>Meftah told me that His Excellency the
Minister of Foreign Affairs wished to see me,
so it was arranged that I should drive to Tejerish
the next morning to the Minister's country
residence.</p>

<p>As early as five <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the following day I was
digging in my trunks in search of my frock-coat,
the only masculine attire in Persia that is
considered decent, and without which no respectable
man likes to be seen. Then for the
tall hat; and with the temperature no less than
98&deg; in the shade I started in an open victoria to
drive the nine miles or so to the appointment.</p>

<p>Not being a Persian myself, and not quite
sharing the same ideas of propriety, I felt rather
ridiculous in my get-up, driving across the sunny,
dusty and barren country until we reached the
hills. I had to keep my feet under the seat of
the carriage, for when the sun's rays (thermometer
above 125&deg;) struck my best patent-leather
shoes, the heat was well-nigh intolerable.</p>

<p>At last, after going slowly up-hill through
winding lanes enclosed in mud walls, and along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-105" id="Pg_1-105"></a>[<a href="./images/1-105.png">105</a>]</span>
dry ditches with desiccated trees on either side,
we arrived at the <i>Campagne de Tejerish</i>, and
pulled up in front of a big gate, at the residence
of the Minister.</p>

<p>The trials of the long drive had been great.
With the black frock-coat white with dust, my
feet absolutely broiled in the patent shoes, and
the perspiration streaming down my forehead
and cheeks, I really could not help laughing at
the absurdity of civilised, or semi-civilised
fashions, and at the purposeless suffering inflicted
by them.</p>

<p>There were a number of soldiers at the gate
with clothes undone&mdash;they were practical
people&mdash;and rusty muskets resting idle on a
rack.</p>

<p>"Is Meftah-es-Sultaneh here?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is waiting for you," answered a
soldier as he sprang to his feet. He hurriedly
buttoned up his coat and hitched his belt, and,
seizing a rifle, made a military salute in the
most approved style.</p>

<p>An attendant led me along a well-shaded
avenue to the house, and here I was ushered into
a room where, round tables covered with green
cloth, sat a great many officials. All these men
wore pleated frock-coats of all tints and gradations
of the colours of the rainbow. One and
all rose and politely saluted me before I sat down.</p>

<p>Through the passage one could see another
room in which a number of other officials,
similarly clad and with black astrakan caps,
were opening and sorting out correspondence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-106" id="Pg_1-106"></a>[<a href="./images/1-106.png">106</a>]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly there was a hurried exit of all
present&mdash;very much like a stampede. Up the
avenue a stately, tall figure, garbed in a whitish
frock-coat over which a long loose brown coat
was donned, walked slowly and ponderously with
a crowd of underlings flitting around&mdash;like
mosquitoes round a brilliant light. It was
Mushir-ed-Doulet, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs. He turned round, now to one, then to
another official, smiling occasionally and bowing
gracefully, then glancing fiercely at another and
sternly answering a third.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-10.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-10_th.jpg" alt="H. E. Mushir-ed-Doulet, Minister of Foreign Affairs." title="H. E. Mushir-ed-Doulet, Minister of Foreign Affairs." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"> <span class="smcap">H. E. Mushir-ed-Doulet</span>, Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>I was rather impressed by the remarkable
facility with which he could switch on extreme
courteousness and severity, kindliness and contempt.
His face was at no time, mind you,
subjected to very marked exaggerated changes or
grimaces, such as those by which we generally
expect emotions to show themselves among ourselves,
but the changes in his expression, though
slight, were quite distinct and so expressive that
there was no mistake as to their meaning. A
soft look of compassion; a hard glance of
offended dignity; the veiled eyes deeply absorbed
in reflection; the sudden sparkle in them
at news of success, were plainly visible on his
features, as a clerk approached him bringing correspondence,
or asking his opinion, or reporting
on one matter or another.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of the less important
business was disposed of in this fashion, as the
Minister strode up the avenue to the Foreign
Office building, and more still with two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-107" id="Pg_1-107"></a>[<a href="./images/1-107.png">107</a>]</span>
of the more important personages who escorted
him to his tents some little way from the
avenue.</p>

<p>Meftah-es-Sultaneh, who had disappeared with
the Minister, hurriedly returned and requested
me to follow him. On a sofa under a huge tent,
sat Mushir-ed-Doulet, the Minister, who instantly
rose and greeted me effusively as I entered. He
asked me to sit on his right on the sofa while
Meftah interpreted. His Excellency only spoke
Persian. Cigarettes, cigars, coffee and tea were
immediately brought.</p>

<p>The Minister had a most intelligent head.
As can be seen by the photograph here reproduced,
he might have passed for a European.
He was extremely dignified and business-like in
his manner. His words were few and much to
the point.</p>

<p>Our interview was a pleasant one and I
was able to learn much of interest about the
country. The Minister seemed to lay particular
stress on the friendly relations of Russia and
England, and took particular care to avoid
comments on the more direct relations between
Persia and Russia.</p>

<p>One point in our conversation which his
Excellency seemed very anxious to clear up was,
what would be the future of China? He
seemed keenly interested in learning whether
Russia's or England's influence had the supremacy
in the Heavenly Empire, and whether either of
these nations was actually feared by the Chinese.</p>

<p>"Will the Chinese ever be able to fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-108" id="Pg_1-108"></a>[<a href="./images/1-108.png">108</a>]</span>
England or Russia with success? Were the
Chinese well-armed during the war of 1900?
If properly armed and drilled, what chances had
the Chinese army of winning against the Allies?
Would China be eventually absorbed and divided
into two or more shares by European powers, or
would she be maintained as an Empire?"</p>

<p>Although the Minister did not say so himself,
I could not help suspecting that in his mind the
similarity and probably parallel futures of China
and Persia afforded ground for reflection.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that in many ways the two
countries resemble one another politically,
although Persia, owing to her more important
geographical position, may have a first place in
the race of European greed.</p>

<p>The interest displayed by Persians of all
classes in the Chinese war of 1900 was intense,
and, curiously enough, the feeling seemed to prevail
that China had actually won the war because
the Allies had retreated, leaving the capital and
the country in the hands of the Chinese.</p>

<p>"More than in our actual strength," said a
Persian official once to me, "our safety lies in
the rivalry of Great Britain and Russia, between
which we are wedged. Let those two nations
be friends and we are done for!"</p>

<p>After my visit to the Minister of Foreign
Affairs I had the pleasure of meeting the Prime
Minister, the Minister of War, and the
Minister of Public Works. I found them all
extremely interesting and courteous and well up
in their work. But although talent is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-109" id="Pg_1-109"></a>[<a href="./images/1-109.png">109</a>]</span>
lacking in Persia among statesmen, the country
itself, as it is to-day, does not give these men an
opportunity of shining as brightly as they might.
The whole country is in such a decayed condition
that it needs a thorough overhauling.
Then only it might be converted into quite a
formidable country. It possesses all the necessary
requirements to be a first-class nation.
Talent in exuberance, physical strength, a convenient
geographical position, a good climate,
considerable mineral and some agricultural
resources, are all to be found in Persia. All
that is wanted at present is the development of
the country on a solid, reliable basis, instead of
the insecure, unsteady intrigues upon which
business, whether political or commercial, is
unfortunately carried on in the present state of
affairs.</p>

<p>No one realises this better than the well-to-do
Persian, and nothing would be more welcome
to him than radical reform on the part of the
Shah, and the establishment of the land of Iran
on unshakable foundations. With a national
debt so ridiculously small as Persia has at present,
there is no reason why, with less maladministration,
with her industries pushed, with
her army reorganised and placed on a serviceable
footing, she should not rank as one of the first
and most powerful among Asiatic independent
nations.</p>

<p>We have seen what young Japan, against all
odds, has been able to accomplish in a few years.
All the more should a talented race like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-110" id="Pg_1-110"></a>[<a href="./images/1-110.png">110</a>]</span>
Persians, situated to begin with in a far less
remote position than Japan, and therefore more
favourably for the acquisition of foreign ways,
be able to emulate, and even in a short time
surpass, the marvellous success attained by the
little Islanders of the Far East.</p>

<p>It is grit that is at present lacking in Persia.
The country has a wavering policy that is extremely
injurious to her interests. One cannot
fail to compare her to a good old ship in a dangerous
sea. The men at her helm are perplexed,
and cannot quite see a clear way of steering.
The waves run high and there are plenty of reefs
and rocks about. A black gloomy sky closes the
horizon, forecasting an approaching cyclone.
The ship is leaking on all sides, and the masts
are unsteady; yet when we look at the number
of rocks and reefs and dangers which she has
steered clear through already, we cannot fail to
have some confidence in her captain and crew.
Maybe, if she is able to resist the fast-approaching
and unavoidable clash of the wind and sea
(figuratively England is the full-blown wind,
Russia the sea)&mdash;she may yet reach her destination,
swamped by the waves, dismantled, but not
beyond repair. Her damage, if one looks at her
with the eye of an expert, is after all not so great,
and with little present trouble and expense she
will soon be as good as new. Not, however,
if she is left to rot much longer.</p>

<p>Such is Persia at present. The time has come
when she must go back into the shelter of a safe
harbour, or face the storm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A painful</span> sight is the Persian army. With
the exception of the good Cossack cavalry regiment,
properly fed, dressed, armed and drilled
by foreign instructors such as General Kossackowski,
and Russian officers, the infantry and
artillery are a wretched lot. There is no excuse
for their being so wretched, because there is
hardly a people in Asia who would make better
soldiers than the Persians if they were properly
trained. The Persian is a careless, easy-going
devil, who can live on next to nothing; he is a
good marksman, a splendid walker and horseman.
He is fond of killing, and cares little if he is
killed&mdash;and he is a master at taking cover. These
are all good qualities in a soldier, and if they
were brought out and cultivated; if the soldiers
were punctually paid and fed and clothed and

<p>I was most anxious to see the troops at drill,
and asked a very high military officer when I
might see them.</p>

<p>"We do not drill in summer," was the reply,
"it is too hot!"</p>

<p>"Do you drill in winter?"</p>

<p>"No, it is too cold."</p>

<p>"Are the troops then only drilled in the
autumn and spring?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes. They are principally drilled a
few days before the Shah's birthday, so that they
may look well on the parade before his Majesty."</p>

<p>"I suppose they are also only dressed and shod
on the Shah's birthday?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What type and calibre rifle is used in the
Persian army?"</p>

<p>"Make it plural, as plural as you can. They
have every type under the sun. But," added the
high military officer, "we use of course 'bullet
rifles' (<i>fusils &agrave; balle</i>) not 'small shot guns'!"</p>

<p>This "highly technical explanation" about
finished me up.</p>

<p>As luck or ill-luck would have it, I had an
accident which detained me some four weeks in
Teheran. While at the Resht hotel, it may be
remembered how, walking barefooted on the
matting of my room, an invisible germ bored its
way into the sole of my foot, and I could not get
it out again. One day, in attempting to make
its life as lively as the brute made my foot, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-113" id="Pg_1-113"></a>[<a href="./images/1-113.png">113</a>]</span>
proceeded to pour some drops of concentrated
carbolic acid upon the home of my invisible
tenant. Unluckily, in the operation my arm
caught in the blankets of my bed, and in the
jerk the whole contents of the bottle flowed out,
severely burning all my toes and the lower and
upper part of my foot, upon which the acid had
quickly dripped between the toes.</p>

<p>With the intense heat of Teheran, this became
a very bad sore, and I was unable to stand up for
several days. Some ten days later, having gone
for a drive to get a little air, a carriage coming
full gallop from a side street ran into mine, turning
it over, and I was thrown, injuring my leg
very badly again; so with all these accidents I
was detained in Teheran long enough to witness
the Shah's birthday, and with it, for a few days
previous, the "actual drilling of the troops."</p>

<p>I have heard it said, but will not be responsible
for the statement, that the troops are nearer
their full complement on such an auspicious
occasion than at any other time of the year, so
as to make a "show" before his Majesty. Very
likely this is true. When I was in Teheran a
great commotion took place, which shows how
things are occasionally done in the land of Iran.
The ex-Minister of War, Kawam-ed-douleh,
who had previously been several times Governor
of Teheran, was arrested, by order of the Shah,
for embezzling a half year's pay of the whole
Persian army. Soldiers were sent to his country
residence and the old man, tied on a white mule,
was dragged into Teheran. His cap having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-114" id="Pg_1-114"></a>[<a href="./images/1-114.png">114</a>]</span>
been knocked off&mdash;it is a disgrace to be seen in
public without a hat&mdash;his relations asked that he
should be given a cap, which concession was
granted, on payment of several hundred tomans. A
meal of rice is said to have cost the prisoner a
few more hundred tomans, and so much salt had
purposely been mixed with it that the thirsty
ex-Minister had to ask for copious libations of
water, each tumbler at hundreds of tomans.</p>

<p>Several other high officials were arrested in
connection with these army frauds, and would
probably have lost their heads, had it not been for
the special kindness of the Shah who punished
them by heavy fines, repayment of the sums
appropriated, and exile. It is a well-known fact
in Persia that whether the frauds begin high up
or lower down in the scale of officials, the pay
often does not reach the private soldier, and if it
does is generally reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>The food rations, too, if received by the men
at all, are most irregular, which compels the
soldiers to look out for themselves at the expense
of the general public. This is a very great pity,
for with what the Shah pays for the maintenance
of the army, he could easily, were the money
not appropriated for other purposes, keep quite
an efficient little force, properly instructed,
clothed, and armed.</p>

<p>The drilling of the soldiers, which I witnessed
just before the Shah's birthday, partook very
much of the character of a theatrical performance.
The drilling, which hardly ever lasted
more than a couple of hours a day, was limited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-115" id="Pg_1-115"></a>[<a href="./images/1-115.png">115</a>]</span>
to teaching the soldiers how to keep time while
marching and presenting arms. The brass bands
played <i>fortissimo</i>&mdash;but not <i>benissimo</i>&mdash;all the time,
and various evolutions were gone through in the
spacious <i>place d'armes</i> before the Italian General,
in Persian employ, and a bevy of highly-dressed
Persian officers. There was a great variety of
ragged uniforms, and head-gears, from kolah
caps to brass and tin helmets, and the soldiers'
ages ranged from ten to sixty.</p>

<p>The soldiers seemed very good-humoured and
obedient, and certainly, when I saw them later
before the Shah in their new uniforms, they
looked quite different and had not the wretched
appearance they present in daily life.</p>

<p>But these infantry soldiers do not bear comparison
with the Russian-drilled Persian Cossacks.
The jump is enormous, and well shows what can
be done with these men if method and discipline
are used. Of course perfection could not be
expected in such a short time, especially considering
the difficulties and interference which
foreign officers have to bear from the Persians, but
it is certainly to be regretted that such excellent
material is now practically wasted and useless.</p>

<p>There were several other excitements before I
left Teheran. The head Mullah&mdash;a most important
person&mdash;died, and the whole population
of Teheran turned out to do him honour when
his imposing funeral took place. Curiously
enough, the entire male Jewish community
marched in the funeral procession&mdash;an event
unprecedented, I am told, in the annals of Persian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-116" id="Pg_1-116"></a>[<a href="./images/1-116.png">116</a>]</span>
Mussulman history. The head Mullah, a man
of great wisdom and justice, had, it was said,
been very considerate towards the Jews and had
protected them against persecution: hence this
mark of respect and grief at his death.</p>

<p>The discovery of the ex-Minister of War's
frauds, the death of the head Mullah, the reported
secret attempts to poison the Shah, the
prospects of a drought, the reported murder of
two Russians at Resht, and other minor sources
of discontent, all coming together, gave rise to
fears on the part of Europeans that a revolution
might take place in Teheran. But such rumours
are so very frequent in all Eastern countries that
generally no one attaches any importance to
them until it is too late. Europeans are rather
tolerated than loved in Persia, and a walk
through the native streets or bazaars in Teheran
is quite sufficient to convince one of the fact.
Nor are the Persians to be blamed, for there is
hardly a nation in Asia that has suffered more
often and in a more shameful manner from
European speculators and adventurers than the
land of Iran.</p>

<p>Perhaps the country itself, or rather the people,
with their vainglory and empty pomp, are
particularly adapted to be victimised by impostors
and are easy preys to them. Some of the tricks
that have been played upon them do not lack
humour. Take, for instance, the pretty farce of
the <i>Compagnie g&eacute;n&eacute;rale pour l'&eacute;clairage et le
chauffage en Perse</i>, which undertook to light the
city of Teheran with no less than one thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-117" id="Pg_1-117"></a>[<a href="./images/1-117.png">117</a>]</span>
gas lights. Machinery was really imported at
great expense from Europe for the manufacture
of the gas&mdash;many of the heavier pieces of
machinery are still lying on the roadside between
Resht and Teheran&mdash;extensive premises were
built in Teheran itself, and an elaborate doorway
with a suitable inscription on it, is still to be
seen; but the most important part of all&mdash;the
getting of the coal from which the gas was to be
extracted&mdash;had not been considered. The Lalun
coal mines, which offered a gleam of hope to the
shareholders, were exploited and found practically
useless. The Company and Government came
to loggerheads, each accusing the other of false
dealing, and the result was that the Persians
insisted on the Company lighting up Teheran
with the agreed 1,000 lights. If gas could not
be manufactured, oil lights would do. There
was the signed agreement and the Company
must stick to it.</p>

<p>The Company willingly agreed, but as the
document did not specify the site where each
lamp-post should be situate nearly all were
erected, at a distance of only a few feet from one
another&mdash;a regular forest of them&mdash;in the two
main streets of the European settlement.</p>

<p>One single man is employed after dark to set
the lamps alight, and when he has got to the
end of the two streets he proceeds on his return
journey to blow them all out again. By ten
o'clock everything is in perfect darkness.</p>

<p>The Company now claim that they have
fulfilled their agreement!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-118" id="Pg_1-118"></a>[<a href="./images/1-118.png">118</a>]</span></p>

<p>The Belgian Company for the manufacture of
Beetroot Sugar was another example of how
speculations sometimes go wrong, and no wonder.
In theory the venture seemed quite sound, for
the consumption of sugar in Persia is large, and
if it had been possible to produce cheap sugar in
the country instead of importing it from Russia,
France and India, huge profits would have been
probable; but here again the same mistake was
made as by the gas company. The obtaining of
the raw material was neglected.</p>

<p>The sugar refinery was built at great cost in
this case, too, machinery was imported to
manufacture the three qualities of sugar most
favoured by the Persians&mdash;loaf sugar, crystallised
sugar, and sugar-candy,&mdash;but all this was done
before ascertaining whether it was possible to
grow the right quality of beetroot in sufficient
quantities to make the concern pay. Theoretically
it was proved that it would be possible
to produce local sugar at a price which, while
leaving the Company a huge profit, would easily
beat Russian sugar, by which French and Indian
sugar have now been almost altogether supplanted.</p>

<p>A model farm was actually started (and is still
in existence) near Shah-Abdul Azim, where beetroot
was to be grown in large quantities, the
experts declaring that the soil was better suited
for the crop than any to be found in Europe.
Somehow or other it did not answer as well as
expected. Moreover, the question of providing
coal for the engines proved&mdash;as in the case of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-119" id="Pg_1-119"></a>[<a href="./images/1-119.png">119</a>]</span>
Gas Company&mdash;to be another serious stumbling
block. An attempt to overcome this difficulty
by joining with the Gas Company in working
the Lalun Mines was made, but, alas! proved
an expensive failure.</p>

<p>Moreover, further difficulties were encountered
in obtaining the right manure for the beetroots,
in order that the acids, which delay crystallisation,
might be eliminated; and the inexperience,
carelessness and reluctance with which the
natives took up the new cultivation&mdash;and, as
it did not pay, eventually declined to go on
with it&mdash;render it by no means strange that
the sugar factory, too, which was to make the
fortunes of so many became a derelict enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Persian does not understand the sound
principles on which alone extensive business can
be successful. Partly owing to prevailing circumstances
he is under the misapprehension that
hard cash is synonymous with wealth, and does
not differentiate between treasure, savings, and
savings transformed into capital. This is probably
the main cause of the present anaemic state
of business in the Shah's Empire. Thus, when we
are told there is in Persia enormous "capital" to
be invested, we are not correctly informed. There
are "enormous accumulations of wealth" lying
idle, but there is no "capital" in the true meaning
of the word. These huge sums in hard cash,
in jewellery, or bars of gold and silver, have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-121" id="Pg_1-121"></a>[<a href="./images/1-121.png">121</a>]</span>
hidden for centuries in dark cellars, and for any
good they are to the country and commerce at
large might as well not exist at all.</p>

<p>Partly owing to the covetousness of his neighbours,
partly owing to a racial and not unreasonable
diffidence of all around him, and to the fact
that an Asiatic always feels great satisfaction in
the knowledge that he has all his wealth within
his own reach and protection, rich men of Persia
take particular care to maintain the strictest
secrecy about their possessions, and to conceal
from the view of their neighbours any signs which
might lead them to suspect the accumulation
of any such wealth. We have already seen how
even the houses of the wealthiest are purposely
made humble outwardly so as to escape the notice
of rapacious officials, and it is indeed difficult to
distinguish from the outside between the house
of a millionaire and that of a common merchant.</p>

<p>The Persian, it must be well understood, does
not hide his accumulated treasure from avaricious
reasons; on the contrary, his inclinations are
rather toward extravagance than otherwise, which
extravagance he can only satisfy under a mask
of endless lies and subterfuges. No honest ways
of employing his wealth in a business-like and
safe manner are open to the rich Persian under
the present public maladministration, nor have
the foreign speculations in the country offered
sufficient examples of success to induce natives
to embark upon them again. Far from it; these
enterprises have even made Persians more sceptical
and close than before, and have certainly not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-122" id="Pg_1-122"></a>[<a href="./images/1-122.png">122</a>]</span>
shown foreign ways of transacting business at
the best.</p>

<p>That is why, no other way being open to him,
the Persian who does wish to get rid of his
wealth, prefers to squander his money, both
capital and income (the latter if he possesses
land), in luxurious jewellery and carpets, and
in unhealthy bribery and corruption, or in satisfying
caprices which his voluptuous nature may
suggest. The result? The Persian is driven to
live mostly for his vanity and frivolity&mdash;two
unbusiness-like qualities not tending to the promotion
of commercial enterprise on a large scale,
although it is true that in a small way his failings
give rise and life to certain industries. For
instance, even in remote, poor and small centres
where food is scarce and the buildings humble,
one invariably finds a goldsmith, filigree-workers
and embroidery makers, whereas the necessaries
of life may be more difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>Of course Persia contains a comparatively small
number of Persians of a more adventurous nature,
men who have travelled abroad and have been
bitten with the Western desire for speculation to
increase their money with speed, if not always
with safety; but even these men have mostly
retired within their shells since the colossal <i>fiascos</i>
of the speculations started in Persia by foreign
"company promoters." A considerable number
of Persians, seduced by glowing prospectuses
and misplaced faith in everything foreign, were
dreadfully taken in by the novel experiments&mdash;everything
novel attracts the Persian considerably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-123" id="Pg_1-123"></a>[<a href="./images/1-123.png">123</a>]</span>&mdash;and
readily unearthed solid gold and silver
bars, that had lain for centuries in subterranean
hiding-places, and now came out to be converted
into shares in the various concerns, hardly
worth the paper on which they were printed,
but promising&mdash;according to the prospectus&mdash;to
bring the happy possessors fabulous incomes.</p>

<p>We have seen how the Sugar Refinery, the
Glass Factory, the "Gas" Company&mdash;a more
appropriate name could not have been given&mdash;and
the ill-fated Mining Company have created
well-founded suspicion of foreign ways of increasing
one's capital, nor can we with any fairness
blame the Persians for returning to their old
method of slow accumulation. True enough, a
fortune, if discovered, has a fair possibility of
being seized in the lump by a greedy official,
but that is only a possibility; whereas, when
invested in some foreign speculations the loss
becomes a dead certainty! More even than
the actual loss of the money, the Persians who
burned their fingers by meddling with foreign
schemes felt the scorn of their friends, of whom
they had become the laughing stock.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that to-day the confidence
of the natives towards foreigners has been very
much shaken, and excepting a few men whom
they well know, trust and respect, they regard
most Europeans as adventurers or thieves. The
"treasuring" of capital instead of the investment
of it is, therefore, one of the reasons why industries
in Persia seldom assume large proportions.
It is only the small merchant, content to make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-124" id="Pg_1-124"></a>[<a href="./images/1-124.png">124</a>]</span>
humble profit, who can prosper in his own small
way while more extensive concerns are distrusted.</p>

<p>But it must not be understood that Persians do
not care for money. There is, on the contrary,
hardly a race of people on the face of the earth
with whom the greed for money is developed to
such an abnormal extent as in all classes in the
land of Iran! But, you will ask, how can
money be procured or increased fast and without
trouble in a country where there is no commercial
enterprise, where labour is interfered with, where
capital cannot have a free outlet or investment?
An opening has to be found in illicit ways of
procuring wealth, and the most common form
adopted is the loan of money at high interest on
ample security. As much as 50 per cent., 80 per
cent., 100 per cent. and even more is demanded
and obtained as interest on private loans, 15 per
cent. being the very lowest and deemed most
reasonable indeed! (This does not apply to
foreign banks.) All this may seem strange in a
Mussulman country, where it is against all the
laws of the Koran to lend money at usury, and it
is more strange still to find that the principal
offenders are the Mullahs themselves, who reap
large profits from such illegal financial operations.</p>

<p>The Persian is a dreamer by nature; he
cannot be said to be absolutely lazy, for he is
always absorbed in deep thought&mdash;what the
thoughts are it does not do to analyse too
closely&mdash;but he devotes so much time to think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-125" id="Pg_1-125"></a>[<a href="./images/1-125.png">125</a>]</span>ing
that he seldom can do anything else. His
mind&mdash;like the minds of all people unaccustomed
to hard work and steady, solidly-built enterprise&mdash;runs
to the fantastic, and he ever expects immense
returns for doing nothing. The returns,
if any, and no matter how large they may be,
are ever too small to satisfy his expectations.</p>

<p>As for time, there is no country where it is
worth less than to the natives of Persia. The
<i>ma&ntilde;ana</i> of the Spaniards sinks into perfect insignificance
when compared with the habits of
the land of Iran. Punctuality is unknown&mdash;especially
in payments, for a Persian must take
time to reflect over everything. He cannot be
hurried. A three months' limit of credit&mdash;or
even six months&mdash;seems outrageously short in
the eyes of Persians. Twelve months and eighteen,
twenty, or twenty-four months suit him
better, but even then he is never ready to pay,
unless under great pressure. He does disburse
the money in the end, capital and interest, but
why people should worry over time, and why
it should matter whether payment occurs to-day
or to-morrow are quite beyond him.</p>

<p>If he does transact business, days are wasted in
useless talk and compliments before the subject
with which he intends to deal is incidentally
approached in conversation, and then more hours
and days and weeks, even months have to elapse
before he can make up his mind what to do.
Our haste, and what we consider smartness in
business, are looked upon by the Persian as quite
an acute form of lunacy,&mdash;and really, when one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-126" id="Pg_1-126"></a>[<a href="./images/1-126.png">126</a>]</span>
is thrown much in contact with such delightful
placidity, almost torpor, and looks back upon one's
hard race for a living and one's struggle and
competition in every department, one almost
begins to fancy that we are lunatics after all!</p>

<p class="illc">The Arrival of a Caravan of Silver at the Imperial Bank of Persia.</p>

<p>The Persian must have his hours for praying,
his hours for ablutions, more hours for meditation,
and the rest for sleep and food. Whether
you hasten or not, he thinks, you will only live
the number of years that God wills for you, and
you will live those years in the way that He has
destined for you. Each day will be no longer and
no shorter, your life no sadder and no happier.
Why then hurry?</p>

<p>Amid such philosophic views, business in
European fashion does not promise to prosper.</p>

<p>Unable to attach a true meaning to words&mdash;his
language is beautiful but its flowery form
conduces to endless misunderstandings&mdash;casual
to a degree in fulfilling work as he has stipulated
to do it; such is the Persian of to-day. Whether
the vicissitudes of his country, the fearful wars,
the famines, the climate, the official oppression
have made him so, or whether he has always
been so, is not easy to tell, but that is how he
is now.</p>

<p>Besides all this, each man is endowed with a
maximum of ambition and conceit, each individual
fully believing himself the greatest man
that ever lived and absolute perfection. Moreover
the influence of Mullahs is used to oppose
reform and improvement, so that altogether
the economic development of production, distri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-127" id="Pg_1-127"></a>[<a href="./images/1-127.png">127</a>]</span>bution
and circulation of capital is bound to be
hampered to no mean extent. On examining
things carefully it seems almost astonishing that
the trade of Persia should be as well developed
as it is.</p>

<p>Another difficulty in the way is the currency,
which offers some interesting lessons, and I am
indebted to the author of a paper read before
the Statistical Society for the following details.</p>

<p>Gold is not produced in Persia. Bar gold is
imported in very small quantities only. Gold
coin is a mere commodity&mdash;is quite scarce, and
is mostly used for presents and hoarding. It is
minted principally from Russian Imperials and
Turkish pounds which drift into Persia in small
quantities in the course of business. Goldsmiths,
too, in their work, make use of foreign coins,
although some gold and silver bullion is imported
for manufacturing purposes.</p>

<p>Silver, too, is not obtainable in Persia except
in very small quantities, and the imported silver
comes from Great Britain, <i>via</i> the Gulf or <i>via</i>
Hamburg and Russia. In the year 1901 the
Persian Government, in connection with the
Russian Loan, imported some three million
tomans' worth of silver to be minted, and the
Imperial Bank of Persia another million tomans;
while some 500,000 tomans more were brought
into the country by other importers. But under
normal circumstances the annual output hardly
ever exceeds three to four million tomans. In
1900 it was something between 2,000,000 and
2,500,000 tomans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-128" id="Pg_1-128"></a>[<a href="./images/1-128.png">128</a>]</span></p>

<p>The Mint&mdash;like all other institutions of Persia&mdash;is
in a tumbling-down condition, with an
ancient plant (1877) so obsolete and worn as to
be almost useless. Partly owing to the insufficient
production of coin, partly because of the
export in great quantities of Persian silver
coin into Transcaspia, and, last but not least,
owing to the Persian custom of "making a
corner" by speculators, the commercial centres
of Persia suffer from a normal dearth of silver
coins. Persian silver coin has for the foregoing
reasons a purchasing power of sometimes 20 per
cent. beyond its intrinsic value. In distant cities,
like Yezd or Kerman, it is difficult to obtain
large sums in silver coin at face value, as it
disappears into the villages almost as soon as it
arrives by caravan or post. New coin is generally
in great demand and commands a premium.</p>

<p>So the yearly drain of silver coin from Teheran
as soon as it is minted is very considerable,
especially to the north, north-east and north-west
provinces. This coin does not circulate
but is almost entirely absorbed and never reappears,
the people themselves holding it, as we
have seen, as treasure, and huge quantities finding
their way into Transcaspia and eventually
into Afghanistan, where Persian coin is current
and at a premium, especially on the border land.</p>

<p>In Transcaspia Persian coin is cherished because
the nominally equivalent Persian coin
contains a much larger quantity of silver than
the Russian. Russian silver is a mere token of
currency, or, at best, stands midway between a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-129" id="Pg_1-129"></a>[<a href="./images/1-129.png">129</a>]</span>
token and a standard or international currency,
and its difference when compared with the
Persian coin amounts to no less than 21.92 per
cent. in favour of the Persian. Persian coin,
although defective and about 2 per cent. below
legal weight and fineness, is a standard or international
currency.</p>

<p>It appears that a good deal of the silver exported
into Transcaspia finds its way to Chinese
Turkestan, where it is converted into bars and
ingots, and is used for the inland trade to China.
The Russian Government have done all in their
power to prevent the competition of Persian and
Russian coins in their Transcaspian provinces.
A decree was issued some eleven years ago
forbidding the importation, and in 1897 a
second Ukase further prohibited foreign silver
from entering the country after the 13th of May
(1st of May of our calendar), and a duty of
about 20 per cent. was imposed on silver crossing
the frontier. All this has resulted in silver
entering the provinces by smuggling instead of
openly, but it finds its way there in large quantities
just the same as before.</p>

<p>The Government of Persia does not issue
bank-notes, which would be regarded with
suspicion among the people, but it is interesting
to find that the monopoly granted to the
Imperial Bank of Persia for the issue of paper
money has had excellent results, in Teheran
particularly, where the Bank is held in high
esteem and the notes have been highly appreciated.
In other cities of Persia which I visited,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-130" id="Pg_1-130"></a>[<a href="./images/1-130.png">130</a>]</span>
however, the notes did not circulate, and were
only accepted at the Bank's agencies and in the
bazaar by some of the larger merchants at a
small discount.</p>

<p>Naturally, with the methods adopted by
Persians, and the insecurity which prevails
everywhere, the process of convincing the
natives that a piece of printed paper is equivalent
to so many silver krans, and that the silver
krans will surely be produced in full on demand
is rather a slow one; but the credit of the
Imperial Bank and the popular personality
of Mr. Rabino, the manager, have done much
towards dispelling the suspicions, and since 1890
the notes have assumed a considerable place in
the circulation. In September 1890 the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'circulalation'">circulation</ins>
of them amounted to 29,000 tomans; in
1895 it had gradually increased to 254,000
tomans, and by leaps and bounds had reached the
sum of 1,058,000 in 1900.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is rather curious
to note that in the previous year, 1899, the note
circulation was 589,000 tomans, and became very
nearly double in the following twelve months.</p>

<p>This only applies to Teheran and the principal
cities; in the villages, and in out-of-the-way
towns, notes are out of the question, and even
silver coins are very scarce. A two-kran piece
of the newer type is seldom found, and only one-kran
pieces, little irregular lumps of silver, are
occasionally to be seen. Copper is really the
currency and is a mere subsidiary or token
coinage with a value fluctuating according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-131" id="Pg_1-131"></a>[<a href="./images/1-131.png">131</a>]</span>
local dearth or other causes at almost every place
one goes to.</p>

<p>The precarious system of farming, accompanied
by the corruption of officials, has given an opportunity
for most frequent and flagrant abuses
in the excessive over-issue of copper coin, so that
in many cities copper issued at the nominal value
of 20 shais per kran was current at 30, 40, 50,
and even, in Eastern Persia, at 80 shais per kran.
I myself, on travelling through Persia, never
knew exactly what a kran was worth, as in
almost every province I received a different
exchange of shais for my krans. In Birjand
and Sistan, particularly, the exchange differed
very considerably.</p>

<p>This state of maladministration affects the
poorer classes, for the copper currency forms
their entire fortune. On coming to the throne
the present Shah, with praiseworthy thoughtfulness,
endeavoured to put a stop to this cause of
misery in his people, and ordered the Government
to withdraw some 720,000 tomans' worth of
copper coins at 25 to 30 shais per kran. This
had a good effect, and although much of the
depreciated coin is still in circulation, particularly
in out-of-the-way places, its circulation in the
larger towns has been considerably diminished.</p>

<p>Lately the Government has adopted the
measure of supplying the public with nickel
coins, one-shai and two-shai pieces, which,
although looked at askance at first, are now
found very handy by the natives and circulate
freely, principally in Resht, Kasvin, Teheran and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-132" id="Pg_1-132"></a>[<a href="./images/1-132.png">132</a>]</span>
Isfahan. In other cities I did not see any, nor
would the natives accept mine in payment, and
in villages no one would have anything to do
with them as they were absolutely unknown.
But wherever it has been possible to commence
the circulation of these nickel coins&mdash;which
were struck at the Brussels Mint and which are
quite pretty&mdash;they have been accepted with
great pleasure.</p>

<p>The old gold coins in circulation in Persia&mdash;very
few and far apart&mdash;were the toman, half-toman,
and two-kran piece. The gold had a
legal fineness of 990. The legal weight in grains
troy was: toman, 53.28; half-toman, 26.64;
two-kran piece, 10.656. Weight in pure gold;
toman, 51.7572; half-toman, 26.3736; two-kran
piece, 10.54944.</p>

<p>The new coins are the two-tomans, one-toman
(differentiated in 1879 and subsequent to 1879),
half-toman and two-kran pieces, the gold having
a legal fineness of 900. Legal weight:&mdash;</p>

<p>The older coinage before 1857, a most irregular
coin&mdash;of one kran&mdash;varied considerably
and had an approximate average fineness of 855,
an average weight (grains troy) of 75.88, and a
weight in pure silver of grains troy 64.877, which
is below the correct standard by no less than 6.76

<p>When it is remembered that at the present
rate of exchange the kran can be reckoned at
fivepence in English money, and the toman
as roughly equivalent to one American dollar, it
will be seen that the subdivisions of the kran
are rather minute for the average European
mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Banks of Persia can be divided into three
classes. One, containing the smaller native
bankers, who often combine the jeweller's business
with that of the money changer; the larger
and purely native banking businesses, and then
the foreign banks, such as the Imperial Bank of
Persia (English Bank), the Banque d'Escompte
et de Pr&ecirc;ts (Russian Bank) and the Agency of
the Banque Internationale de Commerce de
Moscow (Banque Poliakoff). There are other
foreign firms too, such as Ziegler and Co., Hotz,
the Persian Gulf Trading Co., etc., which
transact banking to a limited extent besides
their usual and principal trading business; but
these are not banks proper.</p>

<p>The Imperial Bank of Persia, being a purely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-136" id="Pg_1-136"></a>[<a href="./images/1-136.png">136</a>]</span>
British enterprise, is the most interesting to us. Its
main offices are in a most impressive building in
the principal square of Teheran, and it has branch
offices at Tabriz, Isfahan, Meshed, Yezd, Shiraz,
in the Teheran Bazaar, at Bushire and Kermanshah.
It would be useless to go into the
various vicissitudes through which the Bank has
passed since it was first started, and the difficulties
which it encountered in meeting the unusual
ways of doing business of Persians and satisfying
the desires of directors and shareholders in simple
London town. One thing is, nevertheless, certain,
and that is that if the Imperial Bank of
Persia maintains the prestige now belonging
to it, it owes this to Mr. Rabino, of Egyptian
fame, the Manager of the Bank,&mdash;without exception
the most revered foreigner in Persia.</p>

<p>I will not touch on the sore question of the
Persian loans, eventually secured by Russia, but,
curiously enough, the capital of the first loan, at
least, was in great measure practically transferred
from Russia to Persia by the Imperial Bank,
which had the greatest stock of money in
Teheran; nor shall I go into the successful and
unsuccessful ventures of the Bank, such as the
Road Concession, and the Mining Corporation.
As to the road concession, it is beyond doubt that
had the Bank not become alarmed, and had
they held on a little longer, the venture might
have eventually paid, and paid well. But
naturally, in a slow country like Persia, nothing
can be a financial success unless it is given time
to develop properly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-137" id="Pg_1-137"></a>[<a href="./images/1-137.png">137</a>]</span></p>

<p>With regard to its relation with the Banque
d'Escompte et de Pr&ecirc;ts, the Russian Bank&mdash;believed
by some to be a dangerous rival&mdash;matters
may to my mind be seen in two aspects.
I believe that the Russian Bank, far from damaging
the Imperial Bank, has really been a godsend
to it, as it has relieved it by sharing advances to
the Government which in time might have
proved somewhat of a burden on one establishment.
It is a mistake, too, to believe that in a
country like Persia there is not room for two
large concerns like the two above-mentioned
Banks, and that one or the other is bound
to go.</p>

<p>The rumoured enormous successes of the
Russian Bank and its really fast-increasing
prestige are indisputable, but the secret of these
things is well known to the local management
of the Imperial Bank, which could easily follow
suit and quickly surpass the Russians if more
official and political support were forthcoming.</p>

<p>The action of the London Stock Exchange in
depreciating everything Persian, for the sake of
reprisal, is also injurious to the Bank, and more
so to the prestige of this country, though we do
not seem to see that our attitude has done much
more harm to ourselves than to the Persians. It
is true that Persia is a maladministered country,
that there is corruption, that there is intrigue,
and so forth, but is there any other country,
may I ask, where to a greater or smaller extent
the same accusation could not be made? Nor
can we get away from the fact that although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-138" id="Pg_1-138"></a>[<a href="./images/1-138.png">138</a>]</span>
Persia has been discredited on the London market
it is one of the few countries in which the national
debt is extremely small and can easily be met.</p>

<p>The obligations of the Imperial Government
and of Muzaffer-ed-din Shah's signature, have
never failed to be met, nor has the payment of
full interest on mortgages contracted ever been
withheld. Delays may have occurred, but everything
has come right in the end. Our absurd
attitude towards the Persians, when we are at
the same time ready to back up enterprises
that certainly do not afford one-tenth of the
security to be found in Persia, is therefore rather
difficult to understand.</p>

<p>There are few countries in which so much
can be done with a comparatively small outlay
as in Persia. It is not enterprises on a gigantic
scale, nor millions of pounds sterling that are
needed; moderate sums handled with judgment,
knowledge and patient perseverance, would produce
unlooked-for results. Large imported sums
of capital in hard cash are not wanted and would
involve considerable risk. First of all, stands
the danger of the depreciation of capital by the
fall in silver and the gradual rise in exchange
due to the excess of imports over exports.
Then comes the narrowness of the Persian
markets which renders the return of large sums
in cash an extremely long and difficult operation;
and last but not least, the serious fact that capital
is generally imported at a loss, inasmuch as the
intrinsic value of the kran is much below its
exchange value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-139" id="Pg_1-139"></a>[<a href="./images/1-139.png">139</a>]</span></p>

<p>The ideal situation of an English Bank trading
with the East,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is when its capital remains in
gold, whilst its operations are conducted in silver
by means of its deposits. This, because of the
instability in the price of silver as compared with
that of gold, and the risks which follow upon
holding a metal fluctuating in value almost daily.
The situation in Persia, partly owing to the
constant appreciation of the Persian currency,
due to the great dearth of silver produced by
hoarding as well as by the export of coin to
Central Asia, is quite suitable to the system of
banking indicated above.</p>

<p>The difference between the intrinsic and the
exchange value of the kran, notwithstanding the
constant demand for exchange, is quite worthy
of note. Political preoccupation is the principal
cause of the hoarding system in Government
circles, and in the masses the absence of banking
organisations in which the natives have sufficient
confidence to deposit their savings. Slowly but
surely the Persian is beginning to feel the good
effects of depositing his money in a European-managed
Bank offering sound guarantees, and it
is certain that in time all the money required for
trade purposes will be found in Persia itself.</p>

<p>When better communication between the
various commercial centres has been established,
the distribution of the funds as required, now a
matter of great difficulty and risk, will be greatly
facilitated. When the despatching of sums from
one city to another instead of taking minutes by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-140" id="Pg_1-140"></a>[<a href="./images/1-140.png">140</a>]</span>
telegraph or hours by post occupy, under normal
circumstances, days, weeks, a month or even
more, because the payments are made in solid
silver which has to travel by caravan, it is easy
to understand how the dangerous system of
hoarding comes to be practised with impunity
and facility all over Persia.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-15.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-15_th.jpg" alt="A Typical Persian Window. (Mr. Rabino's House, Teheran.)" title="A Typical Persian Window. (Mr. Rabino's House, Teheran.)" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">A Typical Persian Window.</span> (Mr. Rabino's House, Teheran.)</p>

<p>Of course every precaution is taken to foresee
abnormal scarcity of funds, by sending specie to
the places threatened, in order to help trade.
During the summer months, for instance, most
of the floating capital is absorbed in the provinces
by the opium crop in the Yezd and Isfahan
markets, when the silver krans find their way <i>en
masse</i> to the villages, much to the inconvenience
of the two cities. In the autumn a similar
occurrence hampers trade during the export
season of dried fruit and silk from Azerbaijan
and Ghilan, the exchange falling very low
owing to scarcity of money.</p>

<p>A very important item in the Bank's transactions
in Persia is the constant demand for
remittances of revenue to Teheran for Government
purposes, such as payments for the army,
officials, etc., and these remittances amount to
very large sums.</p>

<p>The key to profitable banking in Persia is the
arbitration of foreign exchanges, which being
so intimately connected with internal exchange
allows the latter to be worked at a profit, advantage
being taken of breaks in the level of
prices; but of course, with the introduction of
telegraphs and in future of railways, these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-141" id="Pg_1-141"></a>[<a href="./images/1-141.png">141</a>]</span>
profits will become more and more difficult to
make. In Persia the lack of quick communication
still affords a fair chance of good remuneration
without speculation for the important
services rendered by a bank to trade.</p>

<p>The exchange of Persia upon London is
specially affected by two influences. In the
north by the value of the ruble, the more important
and constant factor, Tabriz, the Persian
centre of the Russian exchange, being the
nearest approach in Persia to a regular market;
and in the south by the rupee exchange, which
differs from the ruble in its being dependent
upon the price of silver.</p>

<p>In a country like Persia, where the exchange
is not always obtainable and money at times is
not to be procured, it is easy to conceive the
difficulty of a bank. Forecasts of movements,
based on general causes, are of little or no value
in Persia. To this must be added the difficulties
of examining and counting coins&mdash;weighing is
not practicable owing to the irregularity of each
coin&mdash;of the transmission of funds to distant
places, and the general ignorance except in
mercantile circles&mdash;of banking methods as we
understand them.</p>

<p>The Imperial Bank is established in Persia,
not as is believed by some persons to do business
for England and English people, but to do business
with everybody. "The spirit of free trade
alone," said Mr. Rabino to me, "must animate
the management of such a bank. Its services
must be at the disposal of all; its impartiality to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-142" id="Pg_1-142"></a>[<a href="./images/1-142.png">142</a>]</span>
English, Russian, Austrian, Persian, or whatever
nationality a customer may belong to, unquestioned.
All must have a fair and generous
treatment." The interests of the Imperial Bank
are firstly those of its shareholders, secondly
those of Persia which gives the Bank hospitality.</p>

<p>The Bank has already rendered inestimable
services to Persia by diffusing sound business
principles, which the Persians seem slowly but
gladly to learn and accept. That the future of a
bank on such true principles is bound to be
crowned with success seems a certainty, but as
has often been pointed out, it would be idle
to fancy that a couple of years or three will
remove the prejudices and peculiar ways of
thinking and of transacting business of an Oriental
race, whose civilisation is so different from ours,
or that the natives will accept our financial
system with its exactitude and punctuality, the
result of ages of experience, unhesitatingly and
immediately.</p>

<p>The Persian requires very careful handling.
He is obstinate, and by mere long, tedious,
passive resistance will often get the better in a
bargain. By the employment of similar methods
however, it is not difficult to obtain one's way in
the end. A good deal of patience is required
and time <i>ad libitum</i>, that is all.</p>

<p>There is no need for a large stock of gold and
rubles, but what is mostly wanted is a greater
number of men who might be sent all over
the country, men with good business heads
and a polite manner, and, above all, men well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-143" id="Pg_1-143"></a>[<a href="./images/1-143.png">143</a>]</span>
suited to the present requirements of the
country.</p>

<p>The Russian, we find,&mdash;contrary to our
popular ideas, which ever depict him knut in
hand,&mdash;almost fraternises with the Asiatics, and
in any case treats them with due consideration as
if they had a right to live, at least in their own
country. Hence his undoubted popularity. But
we, the quintessence of Christianity and charity
towards our neighbours, habitually treat natives
with much needless harshness and reserve, which
far from impressing the natives with our dignity&mdash;as
we think&mdash;renders us ridiculous in their
eyes. A number of younger Englishmen are
beginning to be alive to this fact, and instruction
on this point should form part of the commercial
training of our youths whose lives are to be spent
in the East.</p>

<p>The other important bank in Persia upon
which great hopes are built, although worked on
different lines, is the so-called Russian Bank, the
<i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Pr&ecirc;ts de Perse</i>, as it was at first called
when founded by Poliakoff in 1891. It was an
experiment intended to discover exactly what
was wanted in the country and what was the
best way to attract business. The monopoly
of Public Auctions was obtained in conjunction
with the Mont-de-Pi&eacute;t&eacute;&mdash;a scheme which did
not work very well at first, the natives not being
accustomed to sudden innovations. The concern
subsequently developed into the <i>Bank Estekrasi</i>
(Bank of Loans), or <i>Banque de Pr&ecirc;ts de Perse</i>,
as it styled itself, but financially it did not pay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-144" id="Pg_1-144"></a>[<a href="./images/1-144.png">144</a>]</span>
and at one moment was expected to liquidate.
It is said that it then threatened to amalgamate
with the Imperial Bank. Mr. De Witte, of St.
Petersburg fame, was consulted in the matter,
and took exactly twenty-four hours to make up
his mind on what was the best course to pursue.
He bought the bank up, the State Bank of St.
Petersburg making an advance on the shares.
The Minister of Finance has a right to name
all the officials in the bank, who, for appearance
sake, are not necessarily all of Russian nationality,
and the business is transacted on the same lines
as at the State Bank of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>A most efficient man was sent out as manager;
Mr. Grube, a gentleman of much tact and most
attractive manner, and like Mr. Rabino&mdash;a
genius in his way at finance; a man with a
thorough knowledge of the natives and their
ways. In the short time he has been in Teheran
the bank has made enormous strides, by mere
sound, business capability and manly, straightforward
enterprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Grube has, I think, the advantage of
the manager of the Imperial Bank in the fact
that, when the Russians know they have a good
man at the helm, they let him steer his ship
without interference. He is given absolute
power to do what he thinks right, and is in no
way hampered by shareholders at home. This
freedom naturally gives him a very notable advantage
over the Imperial Bank, which always
has to wait for instructions from London.</p>

<p>Mr. Grube, with whom I had a long and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-145" id="Pg_1-145"></a>[<a href="./images/1-145.png">145</a>]</span>
most interesting conversation, told me how he
spends his days in the bazaar branch of his bank,
where he studies the ways and future possibilities
of the country and its natives, and the best ways
of transacting business compatible with European
principles, and in particular carefully analysing the
best ways of pushing Russian trade and industries
in Persia. In all this he has the absolute
confidence and help of his Government, and it is
really marvellous how much he has been able to
do to further Russian influence in Persia. There
is no trickery, no intrigue, no humbug about it;
but it is mere frank, open competition in which
the stronger nation will come out first.</p>

<p>It was most gratifying to hear in what glowing
terms of respect the managers of the two
rival banks spoke of each other. They were
fighting a financial duel, bravely, fairly, and in a
most gentlemanly manner on both sides. There
was not the slightest shade of false play on either
side, and this I specially mention because of the
absurd articles which one often sees in English
papers, written by hasty or ill-informed correspondents.</p>

<p>Russia's trade, owing to its convenient geographical
position, is bound to beat the English
in Northern Persia, but it should be a good
lesson to us to see, nevertheless, how the Russian
Government comes forward for the protection
of the trade of the country, and does everything
in its power to further it. Russia will even go
so far as to sell rubles at a loss to merchants in
order to encourage trade in Persia, no doubt with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-146" id="Pg_1-146"></a>[<a href="./images/1-146.png">146</a>]</span>
the certainty in sight that as trade develops the
apparent temporary loss will amply be compensated
in due time by big profits.</p>

<p>It is, to an Englishman, quite an eye-opener
to watch how far the Russians will go for the
absolute benefit of their own trade, and this
conduct pursued openly and blamelessly can only
be admired by any fair-minded person. It is
only a pity that we are not yet wide awake
enough to do the same.</p>

<p>The Russian Bank has branches in the principal
cities of Northern Persia, her business being
so far merely confined to the North.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> work of the Imperial Bank has at various
times been hampered by speculators who tried
to make money by misleading the public.
Their speculations were always based on the
prestige of the bank. For instance, take the
Bushire Company and the Fars Trading Company,
Limited, companies started by native
merchants. They illegally issued bank-notes
which, strangely enough, owing to the security
found in the Imperial bank-notes, found no
difficulty in circulating at a small discount,
especially in Shiraz.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Imperial Bank, having in its
conventions with the Persian Government the
exclusive right to issue bank-notes payable at
sight, protested against this infringement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-148" id="Pg_1-148"></a>[<a href="./images/1-148.png">148</a>]</span>
rights, but for a long time got little redress, and
some of the fraudulent bank-notes are to this
day circulating in Southern Persia.</p>

<p>Sooner or later this was bound to interfere
with the bank, as the natives, unaccustomed to
bank-notes, confused the ones with the others.
Moreover, the enemies of the bank took
advantage of this confusion to instigate the
people against the Imperial Bank, making them
believe that the word "Imperial" on the bank-notes
meant that the issuing of bank-notes
was only a new scheme of the Government to
supply people with worthless paper instead of a
currency of sound silver cash. In the southern
provinces this stupid belief spread very rapidly,
and was necessarily accentuated by the issue of
the illegal bank-notes of local private concerns,
which, although bearing foreign names, were
merely Persian undertakings.</p>

<p>Necessarily, the many foreign speculations to
which we have already referred, cannot be said
to have strengthened confidence in anything of
European importation; but the grand successive
abortions of the Belgian and Russian factories&mdash;which
were to make gas, sugar, glass, matches,
etc.&mdash;are hardly to be compared in their disastrous
results to the magnificent English fiasco
of the Tobacco Corporation, which not only
came to grief itself, but nearly caused a revolution
in the country. It is well-known how a
concession was obtained by British capitalists
in 1890 to establish a tobacco monopoly in
Persia, which involved the usual payment of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-149" id="Pg_1-149"></a>[<a href="./images/1-149.png">149</a>]</span>
large sum to the Shah, and presents to high
officials.</p>

<p>The company made a start on a very grand
scale in February, 1891, having the whole
monopoly of purchase and sale of tobacco all
over Persia. No sooner had it begun its work
than a commission of injured native merchants
presented a petition to the Shah to protest
against it. A decree was, however, published
establishing the monopoly of the corporation all
over Persia, and upon this the discontent and
signs of rebellion began.</p>

<p>Yet this affair of the tobacco monopoly
showed what fine, dignified people the Persians
can be if they choose. The want of tact, the
absolute mismanagement and the lack of knowledge
in dealing with the natives, the ridiculous
notion that coercion would at once force the
Persians to accept the tobacco supplied by the
Corporation, fast collected a dense cloud of
danger overhead. Teheran and the other larger
cities were placarded with proclamations instigating
the crowds to murder Europeans and do
away with their work.</p>

<p>But the Persians, notwithstanding their threats,
showed themselves patient, and confident that
the Shah would restore the nation to its former
happiness. In the meantime the company's
agents played the devil all over the empire. It
seems incredible, even in the annals of Persian
history, that so little lack of judgment could
have been shown towards the natives.</p>

<p>The Mullahs saw an excellent opportunity to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-150" id="Pg_1-150"></a>[<a href="./images/1-150.png">150</a>]</span>
undo in a few days the work of Europeans
of several scores of years. "Allah," they
preached to the people, "forbids you to
smoke or touch the impure tobacco sold you
by Europeans." On a given day the Mugte
halh, or high priest of sacred Kerbalah, declared
that the faithful throughout the country must
touch tobacco no more; tobacco, the most
cherished of Persian indulgences.</p>

<p>Mirza Hassan Ashtiani, <i>mujtehed</i> of Teheran,
on whom the Shah relied to pacify the crowds
now in flagrant rebellion, openly preached against
his Sovereign and stood by the veto of his superior
priest at Kerbalah. He went further and
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'exorted'">exhorted</ins> the people to cease smoking, not because
tobacco was impure, but because the Koran says
that it is unlawful to make use of any article
which is not fairly dealt in by all alike.</p>

<p>At a given date all through the Shah's
dominions&mdash;and this shows a good deal of
determination&mdash;the foreigner and his tobacco
were to be treated with contempt. Tobacco
was given up by all. In the bazaars, in the
caravanserais, in the streets, in the houses, where
under ordinary circumstances every man puffed
away at a <i>kalian</i>, a <i>chibuk</i> (small pocket-pipe) or
cigarette, not a single soul could be seen smoking
for days and days. Only the Shah made a point
of smoking in public to encourage the people,
but even his wife and concubines&mdash;at the risk of
incurring disfavour&mdash;refused to smoke, and
smashed the <i>kalians</i> before his eyes. In house-holds
where the men&mdash;ever weaker than women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-151" id="Pg_1-151"></a>[<a href="./images/1-151.png">151</a>]</span>&mdash;could,
after weeks of abstinence, not resist the
temptation in secrecy, their wives destroyed the
pipes.</p>

<p>For several weeks not a single individual
touched tobacco&mdash;a most dignified protest which
quite terrified the Shah and everybody, for,
indeed, it was apparent that people so strong-willed
were not to be trifled with.</p>

<p>In many places the natives broke out into
rebellion, and many lives were lost. Nasr-ed-din
Shah, frightened and perplexed, called the
high Mullah of Teheran to the palace (January
5th-6th, 1892). By his advice the tobacco
monopoly was there and then abolished by an
Imperial Decree, and the privileges granted for
the sale and export of tobacco revoked.
Furthermore, the Mullah only undertook to
pacify the people on condition that all foreign
enterprises and innovations in Persia should be
suppressed; that all people imprisoned during
the riots should be freed, and the families of
those killed fully indemnified.</p>

<p>The sudden end of the Tobacco Corporation
necessarily led to much correspondence with the
British Minister, Sir Frank Lascelles, on the
question of compensation and damages to the
company which, depending on its monopoly,
had entered into agreements, and had already
paid out large sums of money. It was finally
agreed that the Shah should pay &pound;500,000
sterling compensation, and take over the assets
of the company, supposed to be some &pound;140,000,
subject to realisation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-152" id="Pg_1-152"></a>[<a href="./images/1-152.png">152</a>]</span></p>

<p>With the assistance of the Bank of Persia,
a six per cent. loan was issued, which was taken
up principally by the shareholders of the Tobacco
Corporation. The interest and the sinking fund
of this loan were punctually met until the year
1900 when it was repaid in full on the conclusion
of the Russian loan.</p>

<p>In England this failure seems to have been
ascribed to Russian intrigue, but it must in all
fairness be said that had the Russians tried a
similar scheme in a similar manner, they would
have fared even worse than we did. Even
Persian concerns established on European principles
have serious troubles to contend with; but
it was madness to believe that an entire Eastern
nation could, at a moment's notice, be forced to
accept&mdash;in a way most offensive to them&mdash;such
an article of primary use as tobacco, which,
furthermore, was offered at a higher price than
their own tobaccos which they liked better.</p>

<p>There are in Persia a few important European
commercial houses, such as Ziegler and Co., and
Hotz and Son, which have extensive dealings
with Persians. Ziegler and Co. deal in English
imports and in the exportation of carpets, etc.,
whereas Hotz and Son import Russian articles,
which they find cheaper and of easier sale.
Both are eminently respectable firms, and enjoy
the esteem of everybody.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Swiss name, Ziegler and
Co. is an English firm, although, as far as I
know, it has not a single English employee in its
various branches in Persia. The reason, as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-153" id="Pg_1-153"></a>[<a href="./images/1-153.png">153</a>]</span>
have seen, is that foreigners are considered more
capable. It has in the various cities some very
able Swiss agents, who work most sensibly and
excellently, and who certainly manage to make
the best of whatever business there is to be done
in the country. For over thirty years the house
has been established in Persia, having begun its
life at Tabriz and then extended to Teheran,
Resht, Meshed, Isfahan, Yezd&mdash;the latter so far
a non-important branch&mdash;and Shiraz, Bushire,
Bandar Abbas and Bagdad, where it has correspondents
working for the firm.</p>

<p>The house imports large quantities of Manchester
goods and exports chiefly carpets, cloths,
opium and dried fruit. The carpets, which are
specially made for the European market, are
manufactured chiefly at Sultanabad where thousands
of hands are employed at the looms,
scattered about in private houses of the people
and not in a large factory. The firm takes
special care to furnish good wool and cottons
coloured with vegetable dyes, and not with
aniline. Ancient patterns are selected and
copied in preference to new designs. Of
course, besides these, other carpets are purchased
in other parts of the country. Carpets
may be divided into three classes. The scarce
and most expensive pure silk rugs; the <i>lamsavieh</i>
or good quality carpets, and the <i>mojodeh</i> or
cheaper kind. There is a good demand for
the two latter <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'qualites'">qualities</ins> all over Europe and in
America.</p>

<p>Articles specially dealt in are the cotton and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-154" id="Pg_1-154"></a>[<a href="./images/1-154.png">154</a>]</span>
wool fabrics called <i>ghilim</i>, the designs of which
are most artistic; and to a certain extent other
fabrics, such as the vividly coloured Kashan
velvets, the watered silks of Resht, the Kerman
cloths resembling those of Cashmir, the silver
and gold embroidered brocades of Yezd, and
the silk handkerchiefs manufactured in the
various silk districts, principally Tabriz, Resht,
Kashan and Yezd.</p>

<p>The stamped and hand-drawn <i>kalamkars</i> in
stringent colours upon white cotton also find
their way in large quantities to Europe, but are
more quaint than beautiful. Large and ill-proportioned
figures are frequently attempted
in these designs. When of truly Persian manufacture
the colours are said to be quite permanent
under the action of both light and water.</p>

<p>The firm of Hotz and Son deals in well-nigh
everything, and has made good headway of late
years. It has large establishments at Isfahan,
Shiraz and Bushire, and two agencies, one at
Ahwaz on the Karun River, and one in Teheran
(Groeneweg, Dunlop, and Co.); while it has
correspondents in Bagdad, Busrah, Hongkong
and Rotterdam, the head offices being in
London. Its carpet manufacturing business in
Sultanabad is now carried on by the Persian
Manufacturing Co. The exports are similar to
those of Ziegler and Co.</p>

<p>There are also smaller firms, particularly in
Teheran, such as the Toko, Virion, and others
who do a retail business in piece goods and
articles of any kind, and are entirely in the hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-155" id="Pg_1-155"></a>[<a href="./images/1-155.png">155</a>]</span>
of foreigners, Belgians, Austrians, and French.
Without reference to statistics, which are absolutely
worthless in a country like Persia, the
yearly foreign trade of Persia, divided between
the Gulf ports and the north and north-western
and south-western frontiers, may be put down
roughly at some nine or ten millions sterling.</p>

<p>The Russian trade in the north may be
considered as about equal to the British in the
south. Then there are the goods brought by
the Trebizonde-Tabriz trade route from Turkey
and the Mediterranean, and by the Bagdad-Kermanshah,
another very important route.</p>

<p>The extravagant system of farming prevailing
until quite lately in Persia, as well as the uncertainties
of Customs and revenue returns, makes it
difficult to give trustworthy figures; but in future,
probably this year, we may expect some more
reliable data from the new Belgian customs
office, a really sensible and well-managed administration
organised by Monsieur Naus, who is,
indeed, to be congratulated on the success with
which his efforts at bringing about so radical a
reform in the system of collecting duties have in
so short a time been crowned. We often hear in
England that the Customs of Persia are absolutely
in the hands of Russia, and are worked by
Russian officials. Even serious papers like <i>The
Times</i> publish misleading statements of this kind,
but nothing could be more erroneous. M. Naus,
at the head of the Customs, is a Belgian, and so
are nearly all the foreign employees (there are one
or two French, I believe) in Persian employ, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-156" id="Pg_1-156"></a>[<a href="./images/1-156.png">156</a>]</span>
not a single Russian is to be found among their
number. That the Russians hold a comparatively
trifling mortgage on the Customs as a security
for their loan is true, but, as long as Persia is
able to pay interest on it, Russia has no more
power over the Persian Customs than we have.
Under regular and honest management, like the
present, the Customs have already given considerable
results, and were it not for the weakness of
the Government in the provinces, the Customs
receipts might easily be doubled, even without a
change in the tariff.</p>

<p>The duties levied in Persia are determined by
the treaty of Turkmantchai with Russia in 1828,
by which a uniform and reciprocal five per cent.
for import and export was agreed to, a special
convention, nevertheless, applying to Turkey,
which fixed a reciprocal 12 per cent. export and
6 per cent. import duty, and 75 per cent. on
tobacco and salt. An attempt was made to
negotiate a new commercial treaty with Russia
last year, but unfortunately, matters did not go
as was expected by M. Naus, who was very
keen on the subject. A high Russian official
was despatched to Teheran who caused a good
deal of trouble, and eventually the whole matter
fell through.</p>

<p>Regarding the employment of foreigners by
the Persian Government, it is not out of place to
recall the Maclean incident.</p>

<p>An agreement had been entered into with
Mr. Maclean, a British subject, and a former
employee of the Imperial Bank, to take charge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-157" id="Pg_1-157"></a>[<a href="./images/1-157.png">157</a>]</span>
of the Mint, in order to bring it up to date and
work it on more business-like principles than at
present. This led to a demand from the Russians
that a similarly high office in the Shah's Government
should be given to a Russian, so that this
appointment might not be taken as a slight
against Russia; or, if this were not possible, that
two or three Russians might be employed instead
in minor capacities in the new Customs. The
Persian Government would not agree to this, but
owing to the pressure that had been brought to
bear by the Russians they felt obliged to dismiss
Mr. Maclean. The British minister necessarily
then stood up for British rights, and a great
scandal was made of the whole affair, and as an
agreement for three years had been signed, the
Persian Government had to pay the salary in full
for that period, although they had only availed
themselves of Mr. Maclean's services for a few
months.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the Sadrazam acted
in so reckless a manner, for the whole matter
might have been settled quietly without the
slightest disturbance and unpleasantness. Anyhow,
this led to a decree being passed (in 1901)
that in future <i>no British subject, no Russian, and no
Turk</i> will be accepted in Persian employ. This
includes the army, with the exception of the
special Cossack regiment which had previously
been formed under Russian instructors. It can
safely be said that there is not a single Russian
in any civil appointment in Persia, no more than
there is any Britisher; but, in the Customs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-158" id="Pg_1-158"></a>[<a href="./images/1-158.png">158</a>]</span>
service particularly, M. Naus being a Belgian,
nearly all the employees are Belgian, as I have
said, with only one or two French lower subordinates.</p>

<p>The Customs service is carried on with great
fairness to all alike, and the mischievous stories
of Russian preference and of the violation of
rules in favour of Russian goods are too ridiculous
to be taken into consideration. One fact is
certain, that any one who takes the trouble to
ascertain facts finds them very different from
what they are represented to be by hasty and
over-excited writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is, unfortunately, a class of Englishmen&mdash;especially
in India&mdash;who have Russia on the
brain, and those people see the Russian everywhere
and in everything. Every humble globe-trotter
in India must be a Russian spy&mdash;even
though he be an Englishman&mdash;and much is
talked about a Russian invasion of India, through
Tibet, through Afghanistan, Persia or Beluchistan.</p>

<p>To any one happening to know these countries
it is almost heartrending to hear such nonsense,
and worse still to see it repeated in serious
papers, which reproduce and comment upon it
gravely for the benefit of the public.</p>

<p>In explanation, and without going into many
details, I will only mention the fact that it is
more difficult than it sounds for armies&mdash;even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-160" id="Pg_1-160"></a>[<a href="./images/1-160.png">160</a>]</span>
for the sturdy Russian soldier&mdash;to march hundreds
of miles across deserts without water for
men and animals, or over a high plateau like
Tibet, where (although suggested by the wise
newspaper Englishman at home as a sanatorium
for British troops in India) the terrific climate,
great altitudes, lack of fuel, and a few other
such trifles would reduce even the largest European
army into a very humble one at the end
of a journey across it.</p>

<p>Then people seem to be ignorant of the fact
that, with a mountainous natural frontier like
the Himahlyas, a Maxim gun or two above each
of the few passable passes would bring to reason
any army&mdash;allowing that it could get thus far&mdash;that
intended to cross over into India!</p>

<p>But, besides, have we not got soldiers to defend
India? Why should we fear the Russians?
Are we not as good as they are? Why should
we ever encourage the so far unconcerned
Russian to come to India by showing our fear?
It is neither manly nor has it any sense in it. The
Russian has no designs whatever upon India at
present&mdash;he does not even dream of advancing
on India&mdash;but should India eventually fall into
Russia's hands&mdash;which is not probable&mdash;believe
me, it will never be by a Russian army marching
into India from the north, or north-west, or
west. The danger, if there is any, may be
found probably very much nearer home, in our
own ignorance and blindness.</p>

<p>We also hear much about the infamy of
Russia in placing a tariff on all goods in transit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-161" id="Pg_1-161"></a>[<a href="./images/1-161.png">161</a>]</span>
for Persia, and we are told that this is another
blow directed at English trade. Such is not the
case. Russia, I am told by people who ought
to know, would be only too glad to come to an
understanding with England on some sensible
basis, but she certainly is not quite so unwise as
we are in letting Germany, her real enemy,
swamp her market with cheap goods. The tariff
is chiefly a protection against Germany. Of
course, if we choose to help Germany to ruin
Russia's markets as well as our own, then
we must suffer in consequence, but looking
ahead towards the future of Asia, it might
possibly not be unwise to come to some sensible
arrangement with Russia, by which her commercial
interests and ours would mutually benefit
instead of suffering as they do at present.</p>

<p>In Persia we are playing a rapidly losing
game. Commercially, as I have already said,
we have lost Northern Persia, and Russian influence
is fast advancing in Southern Persia.
This is surely the time to pull up and change
our tactics, or we shall go to the wall altogether.</p>

<p>As Mr. Joseph Walton, M.P., very ably put
it before the House of Commons on January
22nd, 1902, in the case of Russia we have at
present to contend with abnormal conditions of
competition. It would therefore be wise for the
British Government to reconsider its policy in
order to maintain, at least, our commercial
interests in Southern Persia. The Government
of India, too, should take its share in upholding
British interests&mdash;being directly concerned in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-162" id="Pg_1-162"></a>[<a href="./images/1-162.png">162</a>]</span>
affairs that regard the welfare of Persia. Russia
has gone to great expense to construct two
excellent roads from the north into Persia to
facilitate Russian commerce, and it would be
advisable if we were to do the same from the
south. (One of the roads, the Piri Bazaar&mdash;Kasvin
Road, is said to have cost, including
purchase of the Kasvin Teheran section, something
like half a million sterling). It is indeed
idle, as Mr. Walton said, to adhere to methods
of the past when foreign Governments are adopting
modern methods in order to achieve the
commercial conquest of new regions.</p>

<p>The matter of establishing Consulates, too, is
of the greatest importance. We find even large
trading cities like Kermanshah, Yezd, Shiraz and
Birjand devoid of British Consuls. Undoubtedly
we should wish a priority of right to construct
roads and railways in Southern Persia&mdash;in the
event of the Persians failing to construct these
themselves&mdash;to be recognised, and it seems quite
sensible and fair to let Persia give a similar advantage
to Russia in Northern Persia. Nothing
but a friendly understanding between England
and Russia, which should clearly define the respective
spheres of influence, will save the integrity
of Persia. That country should remain
an independent buffer state between Russia and
India. But to bring about this result it is more
than necessary that we should support Persia
on our side, as much as Russia does on hers,
or the balance is bound to go in the latter's
favour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-163" id="Pg_1-163"></a>[<a href="./images/1-163.png">163</a>]</span></p>

<p>The understanding with Russia should also&mdash;and
I firmly believe Russia would be only too
anxious to acquiesce in this&mdash;provide a protection
against German commercial invasion and enterprise
in the region of the Persian Gulf. Germany&mdash;not
Russia&mdash;is England's bitterest enemy&mdash;all
the more to be dreaded because she is a
"friendly enemy." It is no use to try and keep
out Russia merely to let Germany reap any
commercial advantages that may be got&mdash;and
that is the policy England is following at the
present moment. The question whether or no
we have a secret agreement with Germany, in
connection with the Euphrates Valley Railway,
is a serious one, because, although one cannot
but admire German enterprise in that quarter, it
would be well to support it only in places where
it is not likely to be disastrous to our own trade
and interests generally.</p>

<p>Little or no importance should be attached to
the opinion of the Russian Press in their attacks
upon England. The influential men of Russia,
as well as the Emperor himself, are certainly
anxious to come to a satisfactory understanding
with England regarding affairs not only in Persia
but in Asia generally. An understanding between
the two greatest nations in the world
would, as long as it lasted, certainly maintain the
peace of the world, and would have enormous
control over the smaller nations; whereas petty
combinations can be of little practical solid
assistance or use to us.</p>

<p>As I have pointed out before on several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-164" id="Pg_1-164"></a>[<a href="./images/1-164.png">164</a>]</span>
occasions,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Russia is not to-day what she was
half a century ago. She has developed enough
to know her strength and power, and her soldiers
are probably the finest in Europe&mdash;because the
most practical and physically enduring. Her
steady, firm policy of bold advance, in spite of
our namby-pamby, ridiculous remonstrances, can
but command the admiration of any fair-minded
person, although we may feel sad, very sad, that
we have no men capable of standing up against
it, not with mere empty, pompous words, but
with actual deeds which might delay or stop her
progress. As matters are proceeding now, we
are only forwarding Russia's dream of possessing
a port in the Persian Gulf. She wants it and
she will no doubt get it. In Chapters XXXIII
and XXXIV the question of the point upon
which her aims are directed is gone into more
fully. The undoubted fact remains that, notwithstanding
our constant howling and barking,
she invariably gets what she wants, and even
more, which would lead one to believe that, at
any rate, her fear of us is not very great.</p>

<p>We are told that our aggressive&mdash;by which is
meant retrogressive&mdash;policy towards Russia is
due to our inability to effect an entire reversal of
our policy towards that country, but this is not
the case at all. At any rate, as times and circumstances
have changed, our policy need not
be altogether reversed, but it must necessarily
be subjected to modifications in order to meet
changed conditions. If we stand still while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-165" id="Pg_1-165"></a>[<a href="./images/1-165.png">165</a>]</span>
Russia is going fast ahead, we are perforce left
behind. The policy of drift, which we seem to
favour, is bound to lead us to disaster, and when
we couple with it inefficacious resistance and
bigoted obstruction we cannot be surprised if, in
the end, it only yields us bitter disappointment,
extensive losses, enmity and derision.</p>

<p>The policy of drift is merely caused by our
absolute ignorance of foreign countries. We
drift simply because we do not know what else
to do. We hear noble lords in the Government
say that the reason we did not lend Persia the
paltry two and a half millions sterling was because
"men of business do not lend money
except on proper security, and that before embarking
on any such policy the Government
must be anxious to see whether the security is
both sufficient and suitable." Yes, certainly, but
why did the Government not see? Had the
Government seen they certainly would have
effected the loan. Surely, well-known facts, already
mentioned in previous pages, have proved
very luminously our folly in taking the advice of
incompetent men who judge of matters with
which, to say the least, they are not familiar.
But the real question appears to be, not how to
make a safe and profitable financial investment,
which is no part of the functions of the British
or any other Government, but rather whether it
is not better to lay out a certain sum for a valuable
political object than to allow a formidable
competitor to do so to our prejudice.</p>

<p>Hence the disadvantageous position in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-166" id="Pg_1-166"></a>[<a href="./images/1-166.png">166</a>]</span>
we find ourselves at present, all over Asia, but
particularly in Persia. It would no doubt be
the perfection of an agreement if an amicable
understanding could be arrived at with Russia,
not only regarding Persia but including China,
Manchuria, and Corea as well. A frank and fair
adjustment of Russian and British interests in
these countries could be effected without serious
difficulty, mutual concessions could advantageously
be granted, and mutual advice and
friendly support would lead to remarkably prosperous
results for both countries.</p>

<p>Russia, notwithstanding all we hear of her,
would only be too glad to make sacrifices and
concessions in order to have the friendship and
support of England, and Russia's friendship to
England would, I think, be of very great assistance
to British manufacturers. It must be remembered
that Russia is an enormous country,
and that her markets both for exports and imports
are not to be despised. In machinery
alone huge profits could be made, as well as in
cloths, piece goods, fire-arms, Manchester goods,
worked iron, steel, etc.</p>

<p>Articles of British manufacture are in much
demand in Russia and Siberia, and, should the
British manufacturer see his way to make
articles as required by the buyer, very large
profits could be made in the Russian market.
Also huge profits will eventually be made by the
export of Siberian products into England and the
Continent, a branch of industry which the
Russians themselves are attempting to push into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-167" id="Pg_1-167"></a>[<a href="./images/1-167.png">167</a>]</span>
the British market with the assistance of their
Government.</p>

<p>To return to Persia it must not be forgotten
that British imports into that country (in 1900)
amounted to &pound;1,400,000, whilst Russia imported
&pound;21,974,952 of British goods. Which, after all,
is the customer best worth cultivating: Persia
which takes &pound;1,400,000 of our goods, or Russia
which buys from us for &pound;21,974,952?</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that we are the only
civilising agents of the world, and that the work
of other powers in that direction only tends to
the stagnation of Eastern peoples. One might
affirm with more truth that our intercourse with
the civilisation of the East tends to our own
stagnation. We do impart to the natives, it is
true, some smattering of the semi-barbaric,
obsolete ways we possess ourselves, but standing
aside and trying to look upon matters with the
eye of a rational man, it is really difficult to say
whether what we teach and how we teach it
does really improve the Eastern people or not.
Personally, with a long experience of natives
all over Asia, it appears to me that it
does not.</p>

<p>The Russian, though from a British point of
view altogether a barbarian, does not appear to
spoil the natives quite so much in his work
among them. The natives under his <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
seem happy, and his work of civilisation is
more of the patriarchal style, tending more to
enrich the people, to promote commerce and
trade on appropriate lines, than to educate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-168" id="Pg_1-168"></a>[<a href="./images/1-168.png">168</a>]</span>
masses according to Western methods and laws.
The results are most decidedly good, and anyhow
lead to much greater contentment among
the masses than we can secure, for instance, in
India. Above all things it makes for peace;
the natives are treated with extreme consideration
and kindness, but at the same time they
know that no nonsense is tolerated, and that
is undoubtedly the way most appreciated by
Asiatics.</p>

<p>In Persia, it is to be hoped for the peace of
all that neither Russia nor England will acquire
any territorial rights, but that the integrity of
the Shah's Empire may long be preserved. Only
it would not be unwise to prepare for emergencies
in case the country&mdash;already half spoiled
by European ways&mdash;should one day collapse and
make interference necessary. The integrity of
states in Asia intended to serve as buffers is all
very well when such states can look after themselves,
but with misgovernment and want of
proper reform, as in Persia, great trouble may be
expected sooner than we imagine, unless we on
our side are prepared to help Persia as much as
Russia does on her side.</p>

<p>If this can be done, with little trouble to
ourselves, and in a way agreeable to the Persians,
there is no reason why, as an independent state,
Persia should not fully develop her resources,
reorganise her government and army, become a
powerful nation, and establish a flourishing trade,
Russia and England profiting equally by the
assistance given her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> believe that the Persians are illiterate would
be a mistake, and to think that the masses of
Iran were properly educated would be a greater
mistake still; but, if I may be allowed the
expression, the average Persian cannot be better
described than by saying he is "educated in
ignorance"; or, in other words, the average
Persian is educated, yes; but instructed, no.</p>

<p>If what the people are taught can be called
education&mdash;and we in England should not be the
first to throw stones at others&mdash;the average
Persian is better educated than the average
European. But there is education and education.
It is difficult to find the commonest man
in Persian cities who cannot read to a certain
extent, and most people can also write a little
and have a smattering of arithmetic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-170" id="Pg_1-170"></a>[<a href="./images/1-170.png">170</a>]</span></p>

<p>The teaching, except in the larger and principal
centres, is almost entirely in the hands of the
Mullahs, so that naturally, as in our clerical
schools, religion is taught before all things, verses
of the Koran are learnt by heart, and the various
rites and multiple religious ceremonies are
pounded into the children's brains, and accessory
religious sanitary duties of ablutions, etc., which
are believed to purify the body and bring it
nearer to Allah, are inculcated. Even in remoter
villages, the boys are taught these things in the
Mosques as well as a little reading, and enough
writing for daily uses and how to add and subtract
and multiply figures. Famous bits of
national poetry and further passages from the
Koran are committed to memory.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-18.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-18_th.jpg" alt="Iman Jumeh. Head Priest of Teheran, and Official Sayer of Prayers to the Shah." title="Iman Jumeh. Head Priest of Teheran, and Official Sayer of Prayers to the Shah." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Iman Jumeh.</span> Head Priest of Teheran, and Official Sayer of Prayers to the Shah.</p>

<p>In the large cities a higher education can be
obtained in the elaborate Madrassahs adjoining
the mosques, and here, too, entirely at the hands
of the Mullahs; but these higher colleges, a
kind of university, are only frequented by the
richer and better people, by those who intend to
devote themselves to medicine, to jurisprudence,
or to theological studies. Literature and art and
science, all based mostly on the everlasting
Koran, are here taught <i>&agrave; fond</i>, the students
spending many years in deep and serious study.
These are the old-fashioned and more common
schools. But new schools in European or semi-European
style also exist and, considering all
things, are really excellent.</p>

<p>In Teheran, a Royal College has been in
existence for some years. It has first-class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-171" id="Pg_1-171"></a>[<a href="./images/1-171.png">171</a>]</span>
foreign teachers, besides native instructors educated
in Europe, and supplies the highest instruction
to the students. Modern languages are
taught to perfection, the higher mathematics, international
jurisprudence, chemistry, philosophy,
military strategy, and I do not know what
else! I understood from some of the professors
that the students were remarkable for
their quickness and intelligence as compared
with Europeans, and I myself, on meeting some
of the students who had been and others who
were being instructed in the University, was
very much struck by their facility in learning
matters so foreign to them, and by their astounding
faculty of retaining what they had learnt.
It must be recollected that the various scientific
lessons and lectures were delivered not in Persian,
but in some foreign language, usually French,
which intensified their difficulty of apprehending.</p>

<p>Other private schools have also been started
on similar principles in various parts of the
Empire. Even in Yezd a most excellent school
on similar lines is to be found and will be
described later on.</p>

<p>Naturally the Mullahs look askance upon
these Government schools, in which foreign
methods are adopted. The Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise
of Paris, which has a committee in Teheran,
has opened a French school under the direction
of Mr. Virioz, a certificated professor. The
school has nearly 100 pupils, all natives. This
is a primary school, of which the studies are in
French, but a Mullah has been added to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-172" id="Pg_1-172"></a>[<a href="./images/1-172.png">172</a>]</span>
staff to teach the Koran and religious subjects.
In Hamadan, a large Jewish centre, the Alliance
Israelite has opened important schools which
have largely drained the American Presbyterian
schools of their Jewish pupils. Other secular
schools, it appears, are to be opened in which
foreign education is to be imparted, and no
doubt this is a first and most excellent step of
Persia towards the improvement, if not the actual
reform, of the old country.</p>

<p>Not that the religious education received
from the priests was without its good points.
The love for literature and poetry, which it
principally expounded, developed in the people
the more agreeable qualities which have made
the Persian probably the most polite man on this
earth. The clerical education, indeed, worked
first upon the heart, then upon the brain; it
taught reverence for one's parents, love for one's
neighbours, and obedience to one's superiors; it
expounded soft, charitable ways in preference to
aggression or selfishness&mdash;not the right instead
of the duty&mdash;as is frequently the case in secular
schools.</p>

<p>But softness, consideration, poetry, and charity
are things of the past; they can only be indulged
in by barbarians; in civilisation, unluckily, there
is very little use for them except for advertisement
sake. So the Persians were wise to resort to our
style of education, which may yet be the means
of saving their country. They will lose their
courteousness&mdash;they are fast beginning to do that
already&mdash;their filial love, their charity, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-173" id="Pg_1-173"></a>[<a href="./images/1-173.png">173</a>]</span>
the other good qualities they may possess; only
when these are gone will they rank in civilisation
quite as high as any European nation!</p>

<p>The wealthier people send their sons to be
educated abroad in European capitals, and one
cannot help being struck by the wonderful ease
with which these fellows master not only languages,
but science and extremely complex
subjects. Whether this is due to the brain of
young Persians being fresher owing to its not
having been overtaxed for generations&mdash;and therefore
the impressions are clearly received and
firmly recorded, or whether the mode of life
is apt to develop the brain more than any other
part of their anatomy is difficult to say, but the
quickness and lucidity of the average young
Persian brain is certainly astounding when compared
to that of European brains of the same
ages.</p>

<p>The Persian, too, has a most practical way of
looking at things,&mdash;when he does take the
trouble to do so&mdash;not sticking to one point of
view but observing his subject from all round,
as it were, with a good deal of philosophical
humour that is of great help to him in all he
undertakes; and it is curious to see how fast and
thoroughly the younger Persians of better families
can adapt themselves to European ways of thought
and manner without the least embarrassment or
concern. In this, I think, they surpass any
other Asiatic nation, the small community of
the Parsees of India alone excepted.</p>

<p>And here a word or two on the education of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-174" id="Pg_1-174"></a>[<a href="./images/1-174.png">174</a>]</span>
Englishmen intending to make a living abroad,
especially in Asia, and particularly in Persia, will
not, I hope, be out of place. With the fast-growing
intercourse between East and West,
sufficient stress cannot be laid upon the fact
that sound commercial education on up-to-date
principles is chiefly successful in countries undergoing
the processes of development, and that,
above all, the careful study of foreign languages&mdash;the
more the better&mdash;should occupy the attention
of the many students in our country who
are to live in Asia. There is a great deal too
much time absolutely wasted in English schools
over Latin and Greek, not to mention the
exaggerated importance given to games like
cricket, football, tennis, which, if you like, are
all very well to develop the arms and legs, but
seem to have quite the reverse effect upon the
brain.</p>

<p>Yet what is required nowadays to carry a man
through the world are brains, and not muscular
development of limbs. As for a classical education,
it may be all right for a clergyman, a lawyer,
or for a man with high but unprofitable literary
tastes, but not for fellows who are not only to be
useful to themselves, but indirectly to the mother
country, by developing the industries or trades of
lands to be opened up.</p>

<p>If I may be permitted to say so, one of the
principal qualities which we should develop in
our young men is the sense of observation in all
its forms&mdash;a sense which is sadly neglected in
English education. It has always been my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-175" id="Pg_1-175"></a>[<a href="./images/1-175.png">175</a>]</span>
humble experience that one learns more of use in
one hour's keen observation than by reading all
the books in the world, and when that sense is
keenly developed it is quite extraordinary with
what facility one can do things which the average
unobservant man thinks utterly impossible. It
most certainly teaches one to simplify everything
and always to select the best and easiest way in
all one undertakes, which, after all, is the way
leading to success.</p>

<p>Again, when observation is keenly developed,
languages&mdash;or, in fact, anything else&mdash;can be
learnt with amazing facility. The "knack" of
learning languages is only due to observation;
the greatest scientific discoveries have been due to
mere observation; the greatest commercial enterprises
are based on the practical results of observation.
But it is astounding how few people
do really observe, not only carefully, but at all.
The majority of folks might as well be blind for
what they see for themselves. They follow like
sheep what they are told to do, and make their
sons and grandsons do the same; and few countries
suffer more from this than England.</p>

<p>When travelling in the East one cannot help
being struck by the difference of young Englishmen
and foreigners employed in similar capacities
in business places. The foreigner is usually
fluent in four, five or six different languages, and
has a smattering of scientific knowledge which, if
not very deep, is at any rate sufficient for the purposes
required. He is well up in engineering,
electricity, the latest inventions, explorations, dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-176" id="Pg_1-176"></a>[<a href="./images/1-176.png">176</a>]</span>coveries
and commercial devices. He will talk
sensibly on almost any subject; he is moderate
in his habits and careful with his money.</p>

<p>Now, take the young Englishman. He seldom
knows well more than one language; occasionally
one finds fellows who can speak two tongues
fluently; rarely one who is conversant with
three or four. His conversation generally deals
with drinks, the latest or coming races, the relative
values of horses and jockeys and subsequent offers
to bet&mdash;in which he is most proficient. The
local polo, if there is any, or tennis tournaments
afford a further subject for conversation, and then
the lack of discussible topics is made up by more
friendly calls for drinks. The same subjects are
gone through with variations time after time, and
that is about all.</p>

<p>Now, I maintain that this should not be so,
because, taking things all round, the young
Englishman is really <i>au fond</i> brighter and infinitely
more intelligent than foreigners. It is
his education and mode of living that are at fault,
not the individual himself, and this our cousins
the Americans have long since discovered; hence
their steaming ahead of us in every line with the
greatest ease.</p>

<p>We hear that the Englishman is no good at
learning languages, but that is again a great
mistake. I do not believe that there is any
other nation in Europe, after the Russians, who
have greater facility&mdash;if properly cultivated&mdash;and
are more capable of learning languages to perfection
than the English. I am not referring to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-177" id="Pg_1-177"></a>[<a href="./images/1-177.png">177</a>]</span>
every shameless holiday tripper on the Continent
who makes himself a buffoon by using misapplied,
mispronounced, self-mistaught French or Italian
or German sentences, but I mean the rare
observant Englishman who studies languages
seriously and practically.</p>

<p>Speaking from experience, in my travels&mdash;which
extend more or less all over the world&mdash;I
have ever found that Englishmen, when
put to it, could learn languages perfectly. Hence
my remarks, which may seem blunt but are
true. Truly there is no reason why the gift
of learning languages should be neglected in
England,&mdash;a gift which, I think, is greatly
facilitated by developing in young people musical
qualities, if any, and training the ear to observe
and receive sounds correctly,&mdash;a fact to which
we are just beginning to wake up.</p>

<p>It is undoubted that the command of several
languages gives a commercial man an enormous
advantage in the present race of European nations
in trying to obtain a commercial superiority; but
the command of a language requires, too, to a
limited extent the additional etiquette of ways
and manners appropriate to it to make it quite
efficient; and these, as well as the proper manner
of speaking the language itself, can only, I repeat,
be learnt by personal observation.</p>

<p>The Germans train commercial men specially
for the East, men who visit every nook of Asiatic
countries where trade is to be developed, and
closely study the natives, their ways of living,
their requirements, reporting in the most minute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-178" id="Pg_1-178"></a>[<a href="./images/1-178.png">178</a>]</span>
manner upon them, so that the German manufacturers
may provide suitable articles for the
various markets. In the specific case of Persia,
Russia, the predominant country in the North,
does exactly the same. The Russian manufacturer
studies his client, his habits, his customs,
and supplies him with what he desires and
cherishes, and does not, like the British manufacturer,
export to Eastern countries articles
which may very well suit the farmer, the cyclist,
or the cabman in England, but not the Persian
agriculturist, camel-driver, or highwayman.</p>

<p>The everlasting argument that the British
manufacturer supplies a better article borders
very much on the idiotic. First of all, setting
apart the doubt whether he does really supply a
better article, what is certain is that a "better
article" may not be of the kind that is wanted
at all by the people. There are in this world
climates and climates, peoples and peoples, religions
and religions, houses and houses, customs
and customs; and therefore the well-made English
article (allowing it to be well-made) which
suits English people is not always adapted for all
other countries, climates, and usages.</p>

<p>Another prevalent mistake in this country is to
believe that the Persian, or any other Oriental,
will only buy cheap things. The Oriental may
endeavour to strike a bargain&mdash;for that is one of
the chief pleasures of his existence, though a fault
which can easily be counter-balanced&mdash;but he is
ever ready to pay well for what he really wants.
Thus, if because of his training in fighting he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-179" id="Pg_1-179"></a>[<a href="./images/1-179.png">179</a>]</span>
requires a certain curl and a particular handle
to his knife; if he fancies a particular pattern
printed or woven in the fabrics he imports, and if
because of his religious notions he prefers his
silver spoons drilled with holes; there does not
seem to be any plausible reason why his wishes
should not be gratified as long as he pays for the
articles supplied.</p>

<p>We, who own half the world, and ought to
know better by this time, seem constantly to
forget that our customs, and ways, seem as ridiculous
to Orientals (to some of ourselves, too,)
quite as ridiculous as theirs to us. In some cases,
even, great offence can be caused by trying to
enforce our methods too suddenly upon Eastern
countries. Civilised people may prefer to blow
their noses with an expensive silk handkerchief,
which they carefully fold up with contents into
the most prominent pocket of their coats;
the unclean Oriental may prefer to close one
nostril by pressing it with his finger and from
the other forcibly eject extraneous matter to a
distance of several feet away, by violent blowing,
repeating the operation with the other nostril.
This may be thought not quite graceful, but is
certainly a most effective method, and possibly
cleaner than ours in the end. We may fancy it
good manners when in public to show little more
of our shirts than the collar and cuffs, but the Persian
or the Hindoo, for instance, prefers to let the
garment dangle to its full extent outside so as to
show its design in full. Again, we may consider
it highly unbecoming and improper for ladies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-180" id="Pg_1-180"></a>[<a href="./images/1-180.png">180</a>]</span>
to show their lower limbs above the ankle; the
Persian lady thinks nothing of that, but deems it
shocking to show her face.</p>

<p>And so we could go on and on; in fact, with
the Persians, one might almost go as far as saying
that, with the exception of eating and drinking
and a few other matters, they do most things in
a contrary way to ours. They remove their shoes,
when we would remove our hats; they shave
their heads and let the beard grow; they sleep
in the day and sit up the greater portion of the
night; they make windows in the roof instead
of in the walls; they inoculate smallpox instead
of vaccinating to prevent it; they travel by night
instead of by day.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to believe that we can
alter in a day the customs, religions, and manners
of millions of natives, and it seems almost
incomprehensible that in such long colonial
experience as ours we have not yet been able to
grasp so simple a fact. But here, again, comes
in my contention that our failing is absolute
lack of observation; unless it be indeed our
conceited notion that other people must rise up
to our standard. Anyhow, we have lost and are
losing heavily by it.</p>

<p>We see the Germans and Austrians swamping
our own Colonies with goods wherewith our
bazaars in India are overflowing; whereas
English articles&mdash;if cottons are excepted&mdash;are
seldom to be seen in the bazaars. This seems
indeed a curious state of affairs. Nor do we
need to go to India. England itself is over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-181" id="Pg_1-181"></a>[<a href="./images/1-181.png">181</a>]</span>flowing
with foreign-made goods. Now, why
should it not be possible&mdash;and certainly more
profitable&mdash;to meet the wishes of natives of
Eastern countries and give them what they
want?</p>

<p>There is another matter which greatly hampers
the British manufacturer, in his dealings with
Persians particularly. It is well to recollect that
the blunt way we have of transacting business
does not always answer with Orientals. Impatience,
too, of which we are ever brimful,
is a bad quality to possess in dealings with Persians.
Times have gone by when England had
practically the monopoly of the trade of the
East and could lay down the law to the buyers.
The influx of Europeans and the extension of
trade to the most remote corners of the globe
have increased to such an extent during the last
few years&mdash;and with these competition&mdash;that
the exporter can no longer use the slack, easy
ways of half-a-century ago, when commercial
supremacy was in our hands, and must look out
for himself.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the language, with a conciliatory,
courteous manner, a good stock of
patience and a fair capacity for sherbet, hot tea
and coffee, will, in Persia, carry a trader much
further in his dealings than the so-called "smarter
ways" appreciated in England or America; and
another point to be remembered in countries
where the natives are unbusiness-like, as they
are in Persia, is that personal influence and trust&mdash;which
the natives can never dissociate from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-182" id="Pg_1-182"></a>[<a href="./images/1-182.png">182</a>]</span>
the bargain in hand&mdash;go a very long way towards
successful trading in Iran.</p>

<p>This is, to my mind, one of the principal
reasons of Russian commercial successes in
Northern Persia. We will not refer here to the
ridiculous idea, so prevalent in England, that
Russia was never and never will be a manufacturing
country. Russia is very fast developing
her young industries, which are pushed to the
utmost by her Government, and what is more,
the work is done in a remarkably practical way,
by people who possess a thorough knowledge of
what they are doing. The natives and the
geographical features of the country have been
carefully studied, and the Russian trading scheme
is carried firmly and steadily on an unshakable
base. We sit and express astonishment at Russian
successes in Persia; the people at home can
hardly be made to realise them, and I have
heard people even discredit them; but this is
only the beginning and nothing to what we shall
see later on unless we proceed to work on similar
sensible lines. It certainly arouses admiration to
see what the Russians can do and how well they
can do it with ridiculously small capital, when
we waste, absolutely waste, immense sums and
accomplish nothing, or even the reverse of what
we intend to accomplish. But there again is the
difference between the observant and the unobservant
man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> geographical situation of Persia, its extent,
the altitude of its plateau above the sea level, its
vast deserts and its mountain ranges, give the
country a good selection of climates, temperatures
and vegetation. We have regions of intense
tropical heat and of almost arctic cold, we have
temperate regions, we have healthy regions,
and regions where everybody is fever-stricken.
Regions with moist air, plenty of water, and big
marshes, and dreary waterless deserts.</p>

<p>Necessarily such natural conditions are bound
to give a great variety of resources which show
themselves in various guises. A quick survey of
the agricultural, industrial and mineral resources
of the principal provinces of Persia according to
up-to-date information may not be out of place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-184" id="Pg_1-184"></a>[<a href="./images/1-184.png">184</a>]</span>
and will help the reader to appreciate the
journey through some of the districts mentioned.</p>

<p>We have already been through Ghilan with
its almost temperate climate in the lowlands, but
damp in the northern portion, where fever is
rampant, but where, at the same time, luxuriant
vegetation with thick forests, grass in abundance,
paddy fields for the extensive cultivation of rice,
olive-groves, vineyards, cotton, wheat, tobacco,
sugar-cane, fruit and all kinds of vegetables
nourish; while the production of silk for export
on a large and fast-increasing scale&mdash;it might be
increased enormously if more modern methods
were adopted&mdash;and wool and cotton fabrics,
mostly for the Persian market, are manufactured.
It exports, mostly to Russia, great quantities of
dried fruit, wool, cotton, and tobacco (made into
cigarettes), salt fish, caviare and oil.</p>

<p>South-east of Ghilan we find Teheran on a
high plateau, its situation giving it a delightful
and healthy climate, but very scanty agricultural
resources owing to lack of water. In and near
the capital city there are good gardens, grown at
considerable expense and trouble, but very little
other vegetation. We have seen in previous
chapters what the industries of the capital, both
native and foreign, are, and what they amount
to; there is also a manufacture of glazed tiles,
quite artistic, but not to be compared in beauty
of design, colour and gloss with the ancient
ones. Teheran is dependent on the neighbouring
provinces and Europe for nearly everything.</p>

<p>This is not, however, the case with Isfahan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-185" id="Pg_1-185"></a>[<a href="./images/1-185.png">185</a>]</span>
the ancient capital, in the province of which
cotton, wheat, Indian corn, tobacco and opium
are grown in fair quantities, the last-named for
export. Mules and horses are reared, and there
are several flourishing industries, such as carpet-making,
metal work, leather tanneries, gold and
silver work, and silk and wool fabrics.</p>

<p>To the east we have Khorassan and Sistan, a
great wheat-growing country with some good
pastures, and also producing opium, sugar-cane,
dates and cotton. In summer the northerly
winds sweeping over the desert are unbearable,
and the winter is intensely cold. In the northern
part of Khorassan snow falls during the coldest
months, but in Sistan the winter is temperate.
Life is extremely cheap for natives in Sistan,
which is a favourite resort for camel men and
their beasts, both from Afghanistan and Beluchistan.
Northern Khorassan is the great centre
of turquoise mining; copper and coal are also
found there, but its local trade, now that the
export of grain is forbidden, is mostly in opium,
worked leather, wool and excellent horses, which
can be purchased for very little money. Camels,
both loading and riding (or fast-going camels) are
also reared here in the southern portion of the
province, the northern part being too cold for
them in winter.</p>

<p>The handsomest and richest districts of
Persia, but not the healthiest, are undoubtedly
the northern ones on the Caspian Sea, or
bordering on Russian territory, such as
Mazanderan, Astrabad, and Azerbaijan. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-186" id="Pg_1-186"></a>[<a href="./images/1-186.png">186</a>]</span>
first two, rice is grown in large quantities,
castor-oil, wheat, cotton and barley; and in
Mazanderan extensive pasturages are found on
the hills for sheep; but not so in Astrabad, which,
owing to its peculiar formation, is exposed to
broiling heat on the sandy wastes, and to terrific
cold on the mountains, but has a fairly temperate
climate in the southern portion of the
province. These&mdash;if the production of silk is
excepted&mdash;are mostly agricultural districts. At
one time Mazanderan had beautiful forests which
are now fast being destroyed. Considerable
bartering is carried on between the towns and the
nomad tribes, in rugs, carpets, horses and mules,
against grain, rice, felts and woollen cloths of
local manufacture.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan, the most northern province of
Persia, with Tabriz as a centre, is very rich in
agricultural products, particularly in rice and
wheat. Notwithstanding the severe climate in
winter, when the snowfall is rather heavy, and
the thermometer down to 20&deg; below zero centigrade
in February, there are good vineyards in
the neighbourhood of Tabriz, and most excellent
vegetables and fruit. Tobacco is successfully
grown (and manufactured for the pipe and into
cigarettes). The heat in summer is intense,
with hot winds and dust storms; but owing to
the altitude (4,420 feet at Tabriz) the nights are
generally cool. In the spring there are torrential
rains, and also towards the end of the autumn,
but the months of May, June, October and
November are quite pleasant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-187" id="Pg_1-187"></a>[<a href="./images/1-187.png">187</a>]</span></p>

<p>The local trade of Azerbaijan is insignificant,
but being on the Russian border the transit trade
has of late assumed large proportions, and is
increasing fast. The importation, for instance, of
Turkey-reds by Russia is growing daily, and also
the importation of silk, in cocoons and manufactured,
velvet, woollen goods, various cotton
goods, raw wool, dyes (such as henna, indigo,
cochineal and others), and sugar, the principal
import of all. With the exception of tea, indigo
and cochineal, which come from India, the
imports into Azerbaijan come almost altogether
from Russia, Turkey, Austria-Hungary and
France. The Russian trade in sugar is enormous
from this quarter.</p>

<p>The carpet trade, which at one time seemed to
be dying out, is now about to enter on a prosperous
phase; but not so the wool-weaving,
which does not go beyond the local market.
Firearms are manufactured and sold to the
Kurds, and jewellery is made; but the principal
exports are dried fruit, raisins, almonds, pistachios,
chiefly to Russia and Turkey; also gum,
oils, raw metals (copper, iron), hides, precious
stones, alimentary products (honey and dried
vegetables), various kinds of wood, live stock
(mainly sheep and oxen), tobacco, raw and
manufactured, dyes, and raw and manufactured
cotton and silk, carpets, rugs, and cloth.</p>

<p>All these exports are to Russia and Turkey,
and do not all necessarily come from Azerbaijan.
The Russians are displaying great activity in this
province, and have established an important branch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-188" id="Pg_1-188"></a>[<a href="./images/1-188.png">188</a>]</span>
of their "Banque d'Escompte et de Pr&ecirc;ts de
Perse." They have obtained road, railway, and
mining concessions, and according to the report of
our consul in Tabriz, the Russian Bank makes
advances, to the extent of fifty per cent., to
merchants dealing in Russian goods, especially
to native exporters of dried fruit, such advances
being repaid in Russia by the sale of such produce,
or in Persia by the sale of corresponding
imports of manufactured goods.</p>

<p>Tabriz itself, being a centre of export of the
produce of Northern Persia, is a promising field
for banking enterprise, and will assume greater
importance even than it has now when the
carriage road scheme, a concession which was
granted by the Shah, is completed, and furnishes
easier communication for trade and travelling
purposes. Russian engineers are said to have
surveyed and mapped the country for the establishment
of a railway system in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>The mineral resources of Azerbaijan are said
to be considerable, iron being found in rich
deposits of hematite; sulphur, copper and
arsenical pyrites, bitumen, lignite, salt, mineral,
ferruginous and sulphurous springs, and variegated
marble. A similar geological formation is
found extending to Hamadan, where beds of
lignite and anthracite exist, and fine marbles and
granites are to be found. Here, too, we have a
trifling market for local produce, but a considerable
transit trade between the capital and
Kermanshah, Bagdad and Tabriz.</p>

<p>Hamadan is mostly famous for its capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-189" id="Pg_1-189"></a>[<a href="./images/1-189.png">189</a>]</span>
tanneries of leather and for its metal work; but
its climate is probably the worst in Persia, if the
suffocating Gulf coast is excepted&mdash;intensely cold
in winter and spring, moist and rainy during the
rest of the year. This produces good pasturages
and gives excellent vegetables, wine of sorts, and
a flourishing poppy culture&mdash;a speciality of the
province.</p>

<p>The same remarks might apply to the
adjoining (south) Malayer and Borujird districts,
which, however, possess a more temperate
climate, although liable to sudden terrific storms
accompanied by torrential rains. There is a
great deal of waste lands in these regions; but,
where irrigated and properly cultivated, wheat
flourishes, as well as fruit trees, vines, vegetables,
poppies, cotton and tobacco. The people are
extremely industrious, being occupied chiefly in
carpet-making for foreign export, and preparing
opium and dried fruit, as well as dyed cottons.
Gold dust is said to be found in beds of streams
and traces of copper in quartz.</p>

<p>Other provinces, such as Kurdistan, are inhabited
by nomadic peoples, who have a small
trade in horses, arms, opium, wool and dates;
but the cultivation of land is necessarily much
neglected except for the supply of local needs.
In many parts it is almost impossible, as for five
or six winter months the soil is buried in snow,
and the heat of the summer is unbearable. There
seem to be no intermediate seasons. The people
live mostly on the caravan traffic from Bagdad to
various trading centres of Persia, and they manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-190" id="Pg_1-190"></a>[<a href="./images/1-190.png">190</a>]</span>facture
coarse cloths, rugs and earthenware of
comparatively little marketable value. Naphtha
does exist, as well as other bituminous springs,
but it is doubtful whether the quantity is sufficient
and whether the naphtha wells are accessible
enough to pay for their exploitation.</p>

<p>That naphtha does exist, not only in Kurdistan,
but in Pusht-i-kuh, Luristan, and all along the
zone extending south of the Caucasus, is possible;
but whether those who bore wells for oil in those
regions will make fortunes similar to those made
in the extraordinarily rich and exceptionally
situated Baku region, is a different matter altogether,
which only the future can show.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-19.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-19_th.jpg" alt="Sahib Divan, who was at various periods Governor of Shiraz and Khorassan." title="Sahib Divan, who was at various periods Governor of Shiraz and Khorassan." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"> <span class="smcap">Sahib Divan</span>, who was at various periods Governor of Shiraz and Khorassan.</p>

<p>The tribes of Pusht-i-kuh are somewhat wild
and unreliable. On the mountain sides are
capital pasturages. A certain amount of grain,
tobacco and fruit are grown, principally for local
consumption.</p>

<p>In Luristan, too, we have partly a nomad
pastoral population. Being a mountainous region
there are extremes of temperature. In the
plains the heat is terrific; but higher up the
climate is temperate and conducive to good pasturages
and even forests. As in the Pusht-i-kuh
mountain district, here, too, wheat, rice and
barley are grown successfully in huge quantities,
and the vine flourishes at certain altitudes as well as
fruit trees. The local commerce consists principally
in live stock, the horses being quite good, and
there is a brisk trade in arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>There remain now the large districts of
Khuzistan, better known as Arabistan, Farsistan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-191" id="Pg_1-191"></a>[<a href="./images/1-191.png">191</a>]</span>
and Laristan. The heat in these provinces is
terrible during the summer, and the latter district
is further exposed to the Scirocco winds of the
Gulf, carrying with them suffocating sand clouds.
If properly developed, and if the barrage of the
Karun river at Ahwaz were put in thorough
repair, the plains of Arabistan could be made the
richest in Persia. Wheat, rice and forage were
grown in enormous quantities at one time, and
cotton, tobacco, henna, indigo and sugar-cane.
But this region, being of special interest to Britain,
a special chapter is devoted to it, as well as to
the possibilities of Farsistan and Laristan, to
which future reference will be made.</p>

<p>The trade in Shiraz wines is fairly developed,
and they are renowned all over Persia. Considering
the primitive method in which they are
made they are really excellent, especially when
properly matured. The better ones resemble
rich sherries, Madeira and port wine.</p>

<p>Indigo, horses, mules and carpets form the
trade of the province which, they say, possesses
undeveloped mineral resources such as sulphur,
lead, presumed deposits of coal, mercury, antimony
and nickel.</p>

<p>Persian Beluchistan is quite undeveloped so far,
and mostly inhabited by nomad tribes, somewhat
brigand-like in many parts and difficult to deal
with. They manufacture rugs and saddle-bags
and breed good horses and sheep. Their trade is
insignificant, and a good deal of their country is
barren. The climate is very hot, and in many
parts most unhealthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> general European idea about Persian
matrimonial affairs is about as inaccurate as is
nearly every other European popular notion of
Eastern customs. We hear a great deal about
Harems, and we fancy that every Persian must
have dozens of wives, while there are people
who seriously believe that the Shah has no less
than one wife for each day of the year, or 365
in all! That is all very pretty fiction, but differs
considerably from real facts.</p>

<p>First of all, it may be well to repeat that by
the Mahommedan doctrine no man can have
more than four wives, and this on the specified
condition that he is able to keep them in comfort,
in separate houses, with separate attendants,
separate personal jewellery, and that he will look
upon them equally, showing no special favour to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-193" id="Pg_1-193"></a>[<a href="./images/1-193.png">193</a>]</span>
any of them which may be the cause of jealousy
or envy. All these conditions make it well-nigh
impossible for any man of sound judgment to
embark in polygamy. Most well-to-do Persians,
therefore, only have one wife.</p>

<p>Another important matter to be taken into
consideration is, that no Persian woman of a
good family will ever marry a man who is
already married. So that the chances of legal
polygamy become at once very small indeed in
young men of the better classes, who do not wish
to ruin their career by marrying below their
own level.</p>

<p>An exception should be made with the lower
and wealthy middle classes, who find a satisfaction
in numbers to make up for quality, and who
are the real polygamists of the country. But
even in their case the real wives are never numerous&mdash;never
above the number permitted by the
Koran,&mdash;the others being merely concubines,
whether temporary or permanent. The Shah
himself has no more than one first wife, with
two or three secondary ones.</p>

<p>In a country where women are kept in strict
seclusion as they are in Persia, the arrangement
of matrimony is rather a complicated matter.
Everybody knows that in Mussulman countries
a girl can only be seen by her nearest relations,
who by law cannot marry her, such as her father,
grandfather, brothers and uncles&mdash;but not by her
cousins, for weddings between cousins are very
frequently arranged in Persia.</p>

<p>It falls upon the mother or sisters of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-194" id="Pg_1-194"></a>[<a href="./images/1-194.png">194</a>]</span>
would-be bridegroom to pick a suitable girl for
him, as a rule, among folks of their own class,
and report to him in glowing terms of her charms,
social and financial advantages. If he has
no mother and sisters, then a complaisant old
lady friend of the family undertakes to act as
middlewoman. There are also women who are
professional match-makers&mdash;quite a remunerative
line of business, I am told. Anyhow, when the
young man has been sufficiently allured into
matrimonial ideas, if he has any common sense
he generally wishes to see the girl before saying
yes or no. This is arranged by a subterfuge.</p>

<p>The women of the house invite the girl to
their home, and the young fellow is hidden
behind a screen or a window or a wall, wherein
convenient apertures have been made for him,
unperceived, to have a good look at the proposed
young lady. This is done several times
until the boy is quite satisfied that he likes her.</p>

<p>The primary difficulty being settled, his
relations proceed on a visit to the girl's father
and mother, and ask them to favour their son
with their daughter's hand.</p>

<p>If the young man is considered well off, well-to-do,
sober and eligible in every way, consent is
given. A day is arranged for the Nomzad&mdash;the
official betrothal day. All the relations, friends
and acquaintances of the two families are invited,
and the women are entertained in the harem
while the men sit outside in the handsome courts
and gardens. The bridegroom's relations have
brought with them presents of jewellery, accord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-195" id="Pg_1-195"></a>[<a href="./images/1-195.png">195</a>]</span>ing
to their means and positions in life, with a
number of expensive shawls, five, six, seven or
more, and a mirror. Also some large trays of
candied sugar.</p>

<p>After a great consumption of tea, sherbet, and
sweets, the young man is publicly proclaimed
suitable for the girl. Music and dancing
(by professionals) are lavishly provided for the
entertainment of guests, on a large or small
scale, according to the position of the parents.</p>

<p>Some time elapses between this first stage of a
young man's doom and the ceremony for the
legal contract and actual wedding. There is no
special period of time specified, and the parties
can well please themselves as to the time when
the nuptial union is to be finally effected.</p>

<p>When the day comes the parties do not go to
the mosque nor the convenient registry office&mdash;Persia
is not yet civilised enough for the latter&mdash;but
a <i>Mujtehed</i> or high priest is sent for, who
brings with him a great many other Mullahs, the
number in due proportion to the prospective
backshish they are to receive for their services.</p>

<p>The wedding ceremony takes place in the
bride's house, where on the appointed day bands,
dancing, singing, and sweets in profusion are
provided for the great number of guests invited.</p>

<p>The high priest eventually adjourns to the
harem, where all the women have collected with
the bride, the room being partitioned off with a
curtain behind which the women sit. The bride
and her mother (or other lady) occupy seats
directly behind the curtain, while the priest with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-196" id="Pg_1-196"></a>[<a href="./images/1-196.png">196</a>]</span>
the bridegroom and his relations take places in
the vacant portion of the room.</p>

<p>The priest in a stentorian voice calls out to the
girl:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This young man, son of so-and-so, etc., etc.,
wants to be your slave. Will you accept him as
your slave?"</p>

<p>(No reply. Trepidation on the bridegroom's
part.)</p>

<p>The priest repeats his question in a yet more
stentorian voice.</p>

<p>Again no reply. The women collect round
the bride and try to induce her to answer. They
stroke her on her back, and caress her face, but
she sulks and is shy and plays with her dress, but
says nothing. When the buzzing noise of the
excited women-folk behind the curtain has
subsided, the priest returns to his charge, while
the expectant bridegroom undergoes the worst
quarter of an hour of his life.</p>

<p>The third time of asking is generally the last,
and twice the girl has already not answered. It
is a terrible moment. Evidently she is not over
anxious to bring about the alliance, or is the
reluctance a mere feminine expedient to make it
understood from the beginning that she is only
conferring a great favour on the bridegroom by
condescending to marry him? The latter hypothesis
is correct, for when the priest thunders for
the third time his former question, a faint voice&mdash;after
a tantalizing delay&mdash;is heard to say "Yes."</p>

<p>The bridegroom, now that this cruel ordeal is
over, begins to breathe again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-197" id="Pg_1-197"></a>[<a href="./images/1-197.png">197</a>]</span></p>

<p>The priest is not yet through his work, and
further asks the girl whether she said "Yes"
out of her will, or was forced to say it. Then
he appeals to the women near her to testify that
this was so, and that the voice he heard behind
the curtain was actually the girl's voice. These
various important points being duly ascertained,
in appropriate Arabic words the priest exclaims:</p>

<p>"I have married this young lady to this man
and this man to this young lady."</p>

<p>The men present on one side of the curtain
nod and (in Arabic) say they accept the arrangement.
The women are overheard to say words
to the same effect from the other side of the
partition. Congratulations are exchanged, and
more sherbet, tea and sweets consumed.</p>

<p>The religious ceremony is over, but not the
trials of the bridegroom, now legal husband.</p>

<p>When sufficient time has elapsed for him to
recover from his previous mental anguish, he is
conveyed by his mother or women relatives into
the harem. All the women are veiled and line
the walls of the drawing-room, where a solitary
chair or cushion on the floor is placed at the end
of the room. He is requested to sit upon it,
which he meekly does. A small tray is now
brought in with tiny little gold coins (silver if
the people are poor) mixed with sweets. The
bridegroom bends his head; and sweets and
coins are poured upon his back and shoulders.
Being round&mdash;the coins, not the shoulders&mdash;they
run about and are scattered all over the
room. All the ladies present gracefully stoop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-198" id="Pg_1-198"></a>[<a href="./images/1-198.png">198</a>]</span>
and seize one pellet of gold, which is kept for
good luck; then servants are called in to collect
the remainder which goes to their special
benefit.</p>

<p>This custom is not unlike our flinging rice for
luck at a married couple.</p>

<p>The bridegroom then returns to the men's
quarters, where he receives the hearty congratulations
of relatives and friends alike.</p>

<p>From this moment the girl becomes his wife,
and the husband has the right to see her whenever
he chooses, but not to cohabit with her
until further ordeals have been gone through.</p>

<p>The husband comes to meet his wife for conversation's
sake in a specially reserved room in
the harem, and each time he comes he brings
presents of jewellery or silks or other valuables
to ingratiate himself. So that, by the time the
real wedding takes place, they can get to be
quite fond of one another.</p>

<p>There is no special limit of time for the last
ceremony to be celebrated. It is merely suited
to the convenience of the parties when all necessary
arrangements are settled, and circumstances
permit.</p>

<p>Usually for ten days or less before the wedding
procession takes place a festival is held in the
bridegroom's house, when the Mullahs, the
friends, acquaintances, relations and neighbours
are invited&mdash;fresh guests being entertained on
each night. Music, dancing, and lavish refreshments
are again provided for the guests. The
men, of course, are entertained separately in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-199" id="Pg_1-199"></a>[<a href="./images/1-199.png">199</a>]</span>
men's quarter, and the women have some fun all
to themselves in the harem.</p>

<p>On the very last evening of the festival a
grand procession is formed in order to convey
the bride from her house to that of her husband.
He, the husband, waits for her at his residence,
where he is busy entertaining guests.</p>

<p>All the bridegroom's relations, with smart
carriages&mdash;and, if he is in some official position,
as most Persians of good families are,&mdash;with
infantry and cavalry soldiers, bands and a large
following of friends and servants on horseback
and on foot proceed to the bride's house.</p>

<p>A special carriage is reserved for the bride and
her mother or old lady relation, and another for
the bridesmaids. She is triumphantly brought
back to the bridegroom's house, her relations
and friends adding to the number in the
procession.</p>

<p>Guns are fired and fireworks let off along the
road and from the bride's and bridegroom's
houses. One good feature of all Persian
festivities is that the poor are never forgotten.
So, when the bride is driven along the streets, a
great many sheep and camels are sacrificed before
her carriage to bring the bride luck and to feed
with their flesh the numberless people who congregate
round to divide the meat of the
slaughtered animals. In the house of the bridegroom,
too, any number of sheep are sacrificed
and distributed among the poor.</p>

<p>There are great rejoicings when the procession
arrives at the house, where the bridegroom is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-200" id="Pg_1-200"></a>[<a href="./images/1-200.png">200</a>]</span>
anxiously awaiting to receive his spouse. As she
alights from the carriage more sheep are sacrificed
on the door-step&mdash;and the husband, too, is
sacrificed to a certain extent, for again he has to
content himself with merely conducting his bride
to the harem and to leave her there. It is only
late in the evening, when all the guests, stuffed
with food, have departed, that the husband is led
by his best man to a special room prepared for
him and his wife in the harem. The bride
comes in, heavily veiled, in the company of her
father or some old and revered relation, who
clasps the hands of husband and wife and joins
them together, making a short and appropriate
speech of congratulation and good wishes for a
happy conjugal existence. Then very wisely
retreats.</p>

<p>There is yet another obstacle: the removal of
the long embroidered veil which hangs gracefully
over the bride's head down to her knees.
This difficulty is easily surmounted by another
present of jewellery, known as the <i>ruhmuhah</i> or
"reward for showing the face." There is no
further reward needed after that, and they are at
last husband and wife, not only in theory but in
fact.</p>

<p>True, some gold coins have to be left under the
furniture to appease expecting servants, and the
next day fresh trials have to be endured by the
bride, who has to receive her lady friends and
accept their most hearty congratulations. This
means more music, more professional dancing,
more sweets, more sherbet, more tea. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-201" id="Pg_1-201"></a>[<a href="./images/1-201.png">201</a>]</span>
gradually, even the festivities die out, and wife
and husband can settle down to a really happy,
quiet, family life, devoid of temptations and full
of fellow-feeling and thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Ten days before this last event takes place the
wife is by custom compelled to send to the
husband's house the endowment which by her
contract she must supply: the whole furniture of
the apartments complete from the kitchen to the
drawing-room, both for the man's quarter and for
her own. Besides this&mdash;which involves her in
considerable expense&mdash;she, of course, further
conveys with her anything of which she may be
the rightful owner. Her father, if well-off, will
frequently present her on her wedding-day with
one or more villages or a sum in cash, and
occasionally will settle on her what would go to
her in the usual course of time after his death.
All this&mdash;in case of divorce or litigation&mdash;remains
the wife's property.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the bridegroom, or his
parents for him, have to settle a sum of money on
the bride before she consents to the marriage, and
this is legally settled upon her by the Mullah in
the wedding contract. She has a right to demand
it whenever she pleases.</p>

<p>It can be seen by all this that a Persian legal
marriage is not a simple matter nor a cheap
undertaking. The expense and formalities
connected with each wedding are enormous, so
that even if people were inclined to polygamy it is
really most difficult for them to carry their desire
into effect. Among the nobility it has become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-202" id="Pg_1-202"></a>[<a href="./images/1-202.png">202</a>]</span>
unfashionable and is to-day considered quite
immoral to have more than one wife.</p>

<p>Partly because the marriages are seldom the
outcome of irresistible&mdash;but fast burning out&mdash;love;
partly because it is difficult for a husband
and almost impossible for a wife to be unfaithful,
divorces in Persia are not common. Besides, on
divorcing a wife, the husband has to pay her in full
the settlement that has been made upon her, and
this prevents many a rash attempt to get rid of
one's better-half. To kill an unfaithful wife is,
in the eyes of Persians, a cheaper and less degrading
way of obtaining justice against an unpardonable
wrong.</p>

<p>One hears a good deal in Persia about a famous
and extraordinarily deep well&mdash;near Shiraz,
I believe&mdash;into which untrue wives were precipitated
by their respective offended husbands, or
by the public executioner; and also how dishonoured
women are occasionally stoned to
death; but these cases are not very frequent
nowadays. The Persian woman is above all
her husband's most intimate friend. He confides
all&mdash;or nearly all&mdash;his secrets to her. She
does the same, or nearly the same with him.
Their interests are mutual, and the love for their
own children unbounded. Each couple absolutely
severed from the outside world, forbidden
to get intoxicated by their religion, with no
excitements to speak of, and the wife in strict
seclusion&mdash;there is really no alternative left for
them than to be virtuous. Women have in
Persia, as in other countries, great influence over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-203" id="Pg_1-203"></a>[<a href="./images/1-203.png">203</a>]</span>
their respective husbands, and through these
mediums feminine power extends very far, both
in politics and commerce.</p>

<p>At the husband's death the property is divided
among his children, each male child taking two
shares to each one share for every girl's part,
after one-eighth of the whole property has been
paid to the deceased's widow, who is entitled to
that amount by right.</p>

<p>Most praiseworthy union exists in most Persian
families, filial love and veneration for parents
being quite as strong as paternal or maternal
affection. Extreme reverence for old age in any
class of man is another trait to be admired in the
Persian character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Persia</span>, they say, is the country of the loveliest
women in the world. It probably has that reputation
because few foreign male judges have ever
seen them. The Persians themselves certainly
would prefer them to any other women. Still,
there is no doubt, from what little one sees of
the Persian woman, that she often possesses very
beautiful languid eyes, with a good deal of
animal magnetism in them. Her skin is extremely
fair&mdash;as white as that of an Italian
or a French woman&mdash;with a slight yellowish
tint which is attractive. They possess when
young very well modelled arms and legs, the
only fault to be found among the majority of
them being the frequent thickness of the wrists
and ankles, which rather takes away from their
refinement. In the very highest classes this is
not so accentuated. The women are usually of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-205" id="Pg_1-205"></a>[<a href="./images/1-205.png">205</a>]</span>
a fair height, not too small, and carry themselves
fairly well, particularly the women of the
lower classes who are accustomed to carry
weights on their head. The better-off women
walk badly, with long steps and a consequent
stoop forward; whereas the poorer ones walk
more firmly with a movement of the hips and
with the spine well arched inwards. The neck
lacks length, but is nicely rounded, and the head
well set on the shoulders.</p>

<p>Anatomically, the body is not striking either
for its beauty or its strength or suppleness. The
breasts, except with girls of a very tender age,
become deformed, and very pendant, and the
great tendency to fatness rather interferes with
the artistic beauty of their outlines.</p>

<p>The skeleton frame of a Persian woman is
curiously constructed, the hip-bones being extremely
developed and broad, whereas the shoulder
blades and shoulders altogether are very narrow
and undeveloped. The hands and feet are generally
good, particularly the hand, which is less
developed and not so coarse as the lower limbs
generally and the feet in particular. The fingers
are usually long and quite supple, with well-proportioned
nails. The thumb is, nevertheless,
hardly ever in good proportion with the rest of
the hand. It generally lacks length and character.
The feet bear the same characteristics as the hands
except, as I have said, that they are infinitely
coarser. Why this should be I cannot explain,
except that intermarriage with different races
and social requirements may be the cause of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-206" id="Pg_1-206"></a>[<a href="./images/1-206.png">206</a>]</span></p>

<p>The head I have left to the last, because it is
from an artist's point of view the most picturesque
part of a Persian woman's anatomy.
It may possibly lack fine chiselled features and
angularity; and the first impression one receives
on looking at a Persian woman's face is that it
wants strength and character&mdash;all the lines of the
face being broad, uninterrupted curves. The
nose is broad and rounded, the cheeks round, the
chin round, the lips large, voluptuous and round&mdash;very
seldom tightly closed; in fact, the lower
lip is frequently drooping. But when it comes
to eyes, eyelashes and eyebrows, there are few
women in the world who can compete with the
Persian. There is exuberant fire and expression
in the Persian feminine organs of vision, large
and almond-shaped, well-cut, and softened by
eyelashes of abnormal length, both on the upper
and lower lid. The powerful, gracefully-curved
eyebrows extend far into the temples, where
they end into a fine point, from the nose, over
which they are very frequently joined. The
iris of the eye is abnormally large, of very rich
dark velvety brown, with jet black pupils, and
the so-called "white of the eye" is of a much
darker tinge than with Europeans&mdash;almost a
light bluish grey. The women seem to have
wonderful control over the muscles of the eyelids
and brows, which render the eyes dangerously
expressive. The habit of artificially blackening
the under lid with <i>Surmah</i>, too, adds, to no
mean extent, to the luminosity and vivid power
of the eyes in contrast to the alabaster-like,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-207" id="Pg_1-207"></a>[<a href="./images/1-207.png">207</a>]</span>
really beautiful skin of the younger Persian
women.</p>

<p>I said "younger," for owing to racial and
climatic conditions the Persian female is a full-grown
woman in every way at the age of ten or
twelve, sometimes even younger. They generally
keep in good compact condition until they are
about twenty or twenty-five, when the fast expanding
process begins, deforming even the most
beautiful into shapeless masses of flesh and fat.
They are said, however, to be capable of bearing
children till the mature age of forty to forty-five,
although from my own observation thirty-five to
forty I should take to be the more common
average at which Persian women are in full
possession of prolific powers.</p>

<p>In the case of Sayids, the descendants of
Mahommed, both sexes of whom are reputed
for their extraordinary powers and vitality,
women are said not to become sterile till after
the age of fifty.</p>

<p>Whether this is a fact or not, I cannot say,
but it is certain that the Sayids are a superior
race altogether, more wiry and less given to
orgies&mdash;drinking and smoking,&mdash;which may
account for their natural powers being preserved
to a later age than with most other natives of
Persia. Their women are very prolific. Sayid
men and women are noticeable even from a tender
age for their robustness and handsome features.
They are dignified and serious in their demeanour,
honest and trustworthy, and are a fine
race altogether.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-208" id="Pg_1-208"></a>[<a href="./images/1-208.png">208</a>]</span></p>

<p>Infanticide after birth is not very common in
Persia, but abortion <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'artifically'">artificially</ins> procured has,
particularly of late, become frequent for the
prevention of large families that cannot be supported.
This is done by primitive methods, not
dissimilar to those used in European countries.
Medicine is occasionally also administered internally.
These cases are naturally illegal, and
although the law of the country is lenient&mdash;or,
rather, short-sighted&mdash;in such matters, any
palpable case, if discovered, would be severely
punished.</p>

<p>The umbilicus of newly-born children is inevitably
tied by a doctor and not by a member
of the family, as with some nations. Circumcision
is practised on male children when
at the age of forty days. It is merely performed
as a sanitary precaution, and is not undergone
for religion's sake.</p>

<p>There are few countries where deformities and
abnormalities are as common as they are in
Persia. In women less than in men; still, they
too are afflicted with a good share of Nature's
freaks. The harelip is probably the most
common abnormality. Webbed and additional
fingers and toes come next. Birth-marks are
very common&mdash;especially very large black moles
on the face and body.</p>

<p>Persian ears are very seldom beautiful. They
are generally more or less malformed and somewhat
coarse in modelling, although they seem to
answer pretty well the purpose for which they
are created. But although the hearing is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-209" id="Pg_1-209"></a>[<a href="./images/1-209.png">209</a>]</span>
good in a general sense, I found that the Persian,
of either sex, had great difficulty in differentiating
very fine modulations of sounds, and this is
probably due to the under-development or degeneration
of the auricular organ, just the same
as in the ears of purely Anglo-Saxon races.</p>

<p>To an observant eye, to my mind, there is no
part of people's anatomy that shows character
and refinement more plainly than the ear.
Much more delicate in texture than the hands
or feet, the ear is, on the other hand, less subject
to misleading modifications by artificial causes
which are bound to affect the other extremities.</p>

<p>The ear of a Persian is, in the greater percentage
of cases, the ear of a degenerate. It is
coarse and lumpy, and somewhat shapeless, with
animal qualities strongly marked in it. Occasionally
one does come across a good ear in
Persia, but very rarely.</p>

<p>Similar remarks might apply to teeth. When
young, men and women have good teeth, of
fairly good shape and length, and frequently so
very firmly set in their sockets as to allow their
possessors to lift heavy weights with them,
pulling ropes tight, etc., when the strength of
the hands is not sufficient. One frequently
notices, however, irregularity, or additional teeth&mdash;caused
again by intermixture of race&mdash;the
upper teeth not fitting properly the lower ones,
and causing undue friction, early injury to the
enamel, and consequent decay. This is also
greatly intensified by the unhealthy state of
Persian blood, especially in people inhabiting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-210" id="Pg_1-210"></a>[<a href="./images/1-210.png">210</a>]</span>
cities, where the worst of venereal complaints
has crept in a more or less virulent form into the
greater part of the population. Add to this, a
disorganized digestion, coloration by constant
smoking, and the injury to the enamel brought
on by the great consumption of sugary stuff;
and if one marvels at all it is that Persian teeth
are as good and serviceable as they are to a fair
age.</p>

<p>Native Persian dentistry is not in a very
advanced stage. With the exception of extraction
by primitive and painful methods,
nothing efficient is done to arrest the progress of
decay.</p>

<p>The Persian nose is well shaped&mdash;but it is not
perfection, mind you&mdash;and generally does not
perform its duties in a creditable manner. It
has nearly all the drawbacks of civilised noses.
Partly owing to defective digestive organs and
the escaping fumes of decayed teeth, the nose,
really very well shaped in young children,
generally alters its shape as they get older, and
it becomes blocked up with mucous matter,
causing it unduly to expand at the bridge, and
giving it rather a stumpy, fat appearance. The
nostrils are not very sharply and powerfully cut
in most cases, and are rounded up and undecided,
a sign of pliant character.</p>

<p>Women have better cut and healthier noses
than men, as they lead a more wholesome life.
In children and young people, however, very
handsome noses are to be seen in Persia. The
sense of odour is not very keen in either sex; in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-211" id="Pg_1-211"></a>[<a href="./images/1-211.png">211</a>]</span>
fact, it is probably the dullest of all Persian senses,
which is not unfortunate for them in a country
where potent smells abound. In experimenting
upon healthy specimens, it was found that only
comparatively strong odours could be detected
by them, nor could they distinguish the difference
between two different scents, when they
did succeed in smelling them at all!</p>

<p>A Persian woman is not seen at her best when
she is dressed. This sounds very shocking, but
it is quite true. Of all the ugly, inartistic,
clumsy, uncomfortable, tasteless, absurd female
attires, that of the Persian lady ranks first.</p>

<p>Let us see a Persian lady indoors, and describe
her various garments in the order in which they
strike the observer. First of all one's eye is
caught by a "bundle" of short skirts&mdash;usually of
very bright colours&mdash;sticking out at the hips,
and not unlike the familiar attire of our ballet
girls&mdash;only shorter. These skirts are made of
cotton, silk or satin, according to the lady's
wealth and position.</p>

<p>There are various versions of how such a
fashion was adopted by Persian ladies. It is of
comparatively modern importation, and up to
fifty or sixty years ago women wore long skirts
reaching down to the ankle. The skirts gradually
got shorter and shorter as the women got
more civilised&mdash;so a Persian assures me&mdash;and
when Nasr-ed-din Shah visited Europe and
brought back to his harem the glowing accounts
of the ladies' dress&mdash;or, rather, undress&mdash;at
the Empire and Alhambra music-hall ballets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-212" id="Pg_1-212"></a>[<a href="./images/1-212.png">212</a>]</span>
which seem to have much attracted him, the
women of his court, in order to compete with
their European rivals, and to gain afresh the
favour of their sovereign, immediately adopted
a similar attire. Scissors were busy, and down
(or up) were the skirts reduced to a minimum
length.</p>

<p>As in other countries, fashions in men and
women are copied from the Court, and so the
women from one end of Persia to the other, in
the cities, took up the hideous custom. One of
the principal points in the fashion is that the
skirt must stick out at the sides. These skirts
are occasionally very elaborate, with heavy gold
braiding round them, richly embroidered, or
covered all over with small pearls. The shape
of the skirt is the same in all classes of women,
but of course the difference lies in the material
with which the dress is made.</p>

<p>Under the skirt appear two heavy, shapeless
legs, in long foreign stockings with garters, or
in tight trousers of cotton or other light material&mdash;a
most unseemly sight. When only the
family are present the latter garments are frequently
omitted.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only attractive part of a woman's
indoor toilet is the neat zouave jacket with
sleeves, breast and back profusely embroidered
in gold, or with pearls. It is called the <i>yel</i>.
When lady friends are expected to call, some
additions are made to the costume. A long veil
fastened to the belt and supported on the projecting
skirt hangs down to the feet. Sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-213" id="Pg_1-213"></a>[<a href="./images/1-213.png">213</a>]</span>
it is left to drag behind. It is quite transparent,
and its purposeless use none of my Persian
friends could explain. "The women like it,
that is all," was the only answer I could elicit, and
that was certainly enough to settle the matter.</p>

<p>Persian women are extremely fond of jewellery,
diamonds, pearls and precious stones. On the
head, the hair being plastered down with a parting
in the centre and knot behind on the neck,
a diadem is worn by the smarter ladies, the <i>tadji</i>.
Those who can afford it have a <i>tadji</i> of diamonds,
the shape varying according to fashion; others
display sprays of pearls. The <i>tadji</i> is a luxurious,
heavy ornament only worn on grand occasions;
then there is another more commonly used, the
<i>nim tadji</i>, or small diadem, a lighter and handsome
feathery jewel worn either in the upper
centre of the forehead, or very daintily and in a
most coquettish way on one side of the head,
where it really looks very pretty indeed against
the shiny jet black hair of the wearer.</p>

<p>Heavy necklaces of gold, pearls, turquoises and
amber are much in vogue, and also solid and
elaborate gold rings and bracelets in profusion on
the fingers and wrists.</p>

<p>Out of doors women in the cities look very
different to what they do indoors, and cannot
be accused of any outward immodesty. One
suspects blue or black bag-like phantoms whom
one meets in the streets to be women, but there
is really nothing to go by to make one sure of
it, for the street costume of the Persian lady is
as complete a disguise as was ever conceived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-214" id="Pg_1-214"></a>[<a href="./images/1-214.png">214</a>]</span></p>

<p>Before going out a huge pair of loose trousers
or bloomers&mdash;the <i>chakchur</i>&mdash;fastened at the waist
and pulled in at the ankle, are assumed, and a
<i>ruh-band</i>&mdash;a thick calico or cotton piece of cloth
about a yard wide, hangs in front of the face, a
small slit some three to four inches long and one
and a half wide, very daintily netted with heavy
embroidery, being left for ventilation's sake and as
a look-out window. This is fastened by means
of a hook behind the head to prevent its falling,
and is held down with one hand at the lower part.
Over all this the <i>chudder</i>&mdash;a black or blue
piece of silk or cotton about two yards square
and matching the colour of the trousers, covers
the whole from head to foot, and just leaves
enough room in front for the ventilating parallelogram.</p>

<p>In public places this cloak is held with the
spare hand quite close to the chin, so that, with
the exception of a mass of black or blue clothing
and a tiny bit of white embroidery over the eyes,
one sees absolutely nothing of the Persian woman
when she promenades about the streets. With
sloping shoulders, broad hips, and huge bloomers,
her silhouette is not unlike a soda-water bottle.</p>

<p>Her feet are socked in white or blue, and she
toddles along on dainty slippers with no back to
the heels. A husband himself could not
recognise his wife out of doors, nor a brother
his sister, unless by some special mark on her
clothing, such as a spot of grease or a patch&mdash;otherwise,
poor and rich, young and old, are all
dressed alike. Of course the diadem and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-215" id="Pg_1-215"></a>[<a href="./images/1-215.png">215</a>]</span>
such ornaments are only worn in the house, and
the <i>chudder</i> rests directly on the head.</p>

<p>Yet with some good fortune one occasionally
gets glimpses of women's faces, for face-screens
and <i>chudders</i> and the rest of them have their
ways of dropping occasionally, or being blown
away by convenient winds, or falling off unexpectedly.
But this is only the case with the
prettier women, the ugly old ones being most
particular not to disillusion and disappoint the
male passers-by.</p>

<p>This is possibly another reason why hasty
travellers have concluded that Persian women
must all be beautiful.</p>

Court&mdash;The Shah&mdash;A graceful speaker&mdash;The Shah's

<i>d&eacute;fil&eacute;</i> of troops&mdash;A blaze of diamonds.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are great rejoicings in Teheran and all
over Persia on the Shah's birthday and the night
previous to it, when grand illuminations of all
the principal buildings, official residences and
business concerns take place. Large sums of
money are spent in decorating the buildings
suitably on such an auspicious occasion, not as in
our country with cheap, vari-coloured cotton rags
and paper floral ornaments, but with very handsome
carpets, numberless looking-glasses of all
sizes and shapes, pictures in gold frames, plants
and fountains. Nor are the lights used of a
tawdry kind. No, they are the best candles that
money can purchase, fitted in nickel-plated
candlesticks with tulip globes&mdash;thousands of them&mdash;and
crystal candelabras of Austrian make, or
rows of paraffin lamps hired for the occasion.</p>

<p>It is customary in Teheran even for foreign
business houses to illuminate their premises
lavishly, and the Atabeg Azam or Prime Minister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-217" id="Pg_1-217"></a>[<a href="./images/1-217.png">217</a>]</span>
and other high officials go during the evening to
pay calls in order to show their appreciation of
the compliment to their sovereign, and admire
the decorations of the leading banks and
merchants' buildings.</p>

<p>In front of each illuminated house carpets are
spread and a number of chairs are prepared for
friends and guests who wish to come and admire
the show. Sherbet, tea, coffee, whisky, brandy,
champagne, cigarettes and all sorts of other
refreshments are provided, and by the time you
have gone round to inspect all the places where
you have been invited, you have been refreshed
to such an extent by the people, who are very
jolly and hospitable, that you begin to see the
illuminations go round you of their own accord.</p>

<p>The show that I witnessed was very interesting
and really well done, the effect in the bazaar,
with all the lights reflected in the mirrors,
and the gold and carpets against the ancient
wood-work of the caravanserais, being quite
picturesque. The crowds of open-mouthed
natives were, as a whole, well behaved, and quite
amusing to watch. They seemed quite absorbed
in studying the details of each bit of decoration.
The Bank of Persia was decorated with much
artistic taste. Side by side, in the wind, two
enormous flags&mdash;the British and the Persian&mdash;flew
on its fa&ccedil;ade.</p>

<p>Fireworks were let off till a late hour of the
night from various parts of the town, and bands
and strolling musicians played in the squares, in
the bazaar, and everywhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-218" id="Pg_1-218"></a>[<a href="./images/1-218.png">218</a>]</span></p>

<p>The following morning the Shah came in
his automobile to town from his country
residence, driven, as usual, by a Frenchman.
The Persian and foreign Ministers were to be
received in audience early in the morning, and
I was to be presented after by Sir Arthur
Hardinge, our Minister at the Shah's Court.</p>

<p>The strict etiquette of any Court&mdash;whether
European or Eastern&mdash;does remind one very
forcibly of the comic opera, only it is occasionally
funnier.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-22.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-22_th.jpg" alt="Ruku Sultaneh, Brother of the present Shah." title="Ruku Sultaneh, Brother of the present Shah." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"> <span class="smcap">Ruku Sultaneh</span>, Brother of the present Shah.</p>

<p>As early as 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we left the Legation in a
procession&mdash;all on horseback&mdash;the officials in
their diplomatic uniforms, with plenty of gold
braiding, and cocked hats; I in my own frock-coat
and somebody else's tall hat, for mine had
unluckily come to grief. We rode along the
very dusty streets and arrived at the Palace,
where we got off our horses. We entered the
large court of the Alabaster Throne. There
were a great many dismounted cavalry soldiers,
and we were then led into a small ante-room on
the first floor where all the foreign representatives
of other nations in Teheran were waiting,
received by a Persian high official.</p>

<p>We were detained here for a considerable
time, and then marched through the garden to
another building. By the number of pairs of
shoes lining both sides of the staircase in quadruple
rows, it was evident that his Majesty had
many visitors. We were ushered into the
Jewelled Globe Room adjoining the Shah's small
reception room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-219" id="Pg_1-219"></a>[<a href="./images/1-219.png">219</a>]</span></p>

<p>After some adjustment of clothes and collars
in their correct positions, and of swords and
belts, the door opened and the Ministers were
let in to the Shah's presence. One peculiarity
of the Shah's court is that it is etiquette to
appear before the sovereign with one's hat on,
and making a military salute. In former days
carpet slippers were provided for the Ministers
to put on over the shoes, but the custom has of
late been abandoned, as it looked too ludicrous,
even for a court, to see the ministers, secretaries,
and attach&eacute;s in their grand uniforms dragging
their feet along for fear of losing a <i>pantoufle</i> on
the way.</p>

<p>There was the usual speech of greeting and
congratulation on the part of the <i>doyen</i> Minister,
and presently the crowd of foreign representatives
returned to the ante-room in the most approved
style, walking backwards and stooping low.</p>

<p>My turn came next. As we entered, the Shah
was standing almost in the centre of the room,
with the familiar aigrette in his <i>kolah</i> (black
headgear) and his chest a blaze of diamonds.
He rested his right hand on a handsome jewelled
sword. He looked pale and somewhat worn,
but his features were decidedly handsome, without
being powerful. One could plainly see
depicted on his face an expression of extreme
good-nature&mdash;almost too soft and thoughtful a
face for a sovereign of an Eastern country. His
thick underlip added a certain amount of obstinate
strength to his features, which was counter-balanced
by the dreamy, far-away look of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-220" id="Pg_1-220"></a>[<a href="./images/1-220.png">220</a>]</span>
eyes heavily shadowed by prominent lids. His
thick black eyebrows and huge moustache were
in great contrast to the Shah's pallid face. His
Majesty appeared bored, and was busy masticating
a walnut when we entered, the shell of
which lay in <i>d&eacute;bris</i> by the side of two additional
entire walnuts and a nut-cracker on a small
jewelled side-table.</p>

<p>We stood at attention with our hats on while
Sir Arthur, who, as we have seen, is a linguist of
great distinction, delivered to the sovereign, a
most charming and graceful speech in Persian
with an oriental fluency of flowery language that
nearly took my breath away.</p>

<p>The Shah seemed highly delighted at the nice
compliments paid him by our Minister, and
graciously smiled in appreciation. Then Sir
Arthur broke forth in French&mdash;which he speaks
like a Frenchman&mdash;and with astounding grace
proceeded to the presentation. The Shah was
curt in his words and much to the point, and I
was greatly delighted at the charming directness
of his remarks. There was no figure of
speech, no tawdry metaphor in the compliment
paid me.</p>

<p>I had presented his Majesty with two of my
books.</p>

<p>"<i>Vous &eacute;crivez livres?</i>" thundered the Shah to
me in lame French, as he stroked his moustache
in a nervous manner.</p>

<p>"<i>Malheureusement pour le public, oui, Majest&eacute;</i>,"
(Unfortunately for the public, yes, your Majesty),
I replied, touching my hat in military fashion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-221" id="Pg_1-221"></a>[<a href="./images/1-221.png">221</a>]</span></p>

<p>"<i>Combien de livres avez vous &eacute;crits?</i>" (How
many books have you written?)</p>

<p>"<i>Quatre, Majest&eacute;.</i>" (Four, your Majesty.)</p>

<p>"<i>Combien livres avez vous envoy&eacute; moi?</i>" (How
many books have you sent me?) he roared again
in his Perso adaptation of French.</p>

<p>"<i>Deux, Majest&eacute;.</i>" (Two, your Majesty.)</p>

<p>"<i>Envoyez encore deux autres.</i>" (Send the other
two.) And with a nod the conversation was
over, and we retreated backwards through the
glass door, but not before Sir Arthur Hardinge
had completed the interview with another most
appropriate and graceful little speech.</p>

<p>The foreign Ministers departed, but I was
allowed to remain in the Palace grounds to witness
the various native officials and representatives
paying their salaams to the Shah.</p>

<p>After us the foreigners in Persian employ were
received in audience, and it was interesting to
notice that they had adopted the Persian headgear,
and some even the Persian pleated frock-coat.
The Shah's reception room had a very
large window overlooking the garden. The
glass was raised and a throne was placed close
to the edge of the window on which the Shah
seated himself with a <i>kalian</i> by his side.</p>

<p>Then began the <i>d&eacute;fil&eacute;</i> of native representatives.
The <i>Kajars</i> in their grand robes and white
turbans paraded before the window, and then
forming a semicircle salaamed the head of their
family. One of them stepped forward and
chanted a long poem, while the Shah puffed
away at the <i>kalian</i> and stroked his luxuriant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-222" id="Pg_1-222"></a>[<a href="./images/1-222.png">222</a>]</span>
moustache. Every now and then the sovereign
bowed in acknowledgment of the good wishes
paid him, and his bow was repeated by the
crowd below in the court. After the Kajars
came the Mullahs. Again another recitation of
poetry, again more bows, more <i>kalian</i> smoking.
Then foreign generals stood before the window,
and native officers, Court servants and eunuchs.
The <i>d&eacute;fil&eacute;</i> of troops, colleges, merchant associations
and schools came next, and was very
interesting.</p>

<p>Persian Cossacks in their nice long white
uniforms and formidable chest ornamentations;
bandsmen with tin helmets and linoleum top
boots; hussars with plenty of braiding on cotton
coats and trousers; infantrymen, artillerymen,
military cadets,&mdash;all were reviewed in turn by
his Majesty, who displayed his royal satisfaction
by an occasional bow.</p>

<p>There were no shrieks of enthusiasm, no applause,
no hurrahs, as they went, but they all
walked past the royal window in a quiet, dignified
way&mdash;no easy matter, considering the extraordinary
clothing that some were made to wear.
One had a sort of suspicion that, not unlike the
armies marching on the stage, one recognised
the same contingents marching past several times
to make up for numbers, but that did not take
away from the picturesqueness of the scene, in
the really beautiful garden, with lovely fountains
spouting and flowers in full bloom.</p>

<p>The procession with banners and music went
on for a very long time, but at last the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-223" id="Pg_1-223"></a>[<a href="./images/1-223.png">223</a>]</span>
garden was cleared of all people. His Majesty
wished to descend for a little walk.</p>

<p>Absolutely alone, the Shah sauntered about,
apparently quite relieved that the ordeal was
over. The Atabeg Azam was signalled to
approach, and Prime Minister and Sovereign
had a friendly conversation.</p>

<p>Although personally not fond of jewellery, I
must confess that I was much impressed by the
resplendent beauty of the Shah's diamonds when
a ray of sun shone upon them. His chest
and the aigrette on the cap were a blaze of
dazzling light, with a myriad of most beautiful
flashing colours.</p>

<p>The great social excitement of the year in
Teheran was the Prime Minister's evening
party on the Shah's birthday, when all the
higher Persian officials were invited, and nearly
all the Europeans resident in Teheran, regardless
of their grade or social position.</p>

<p>This evening party was preceded by an official
dinner to the members of the Legations. Elaborate
fireworks were let off in the beautiful
gardens and reflected in the ponds in front of
the house, and the gardens were tastefully
illuminated with vari-coloured lanterns and
decorated with flags.</p>

<p>The house itself was full of interesting objects of
art, and had spacious rooms in the best European
style. Persian officials, resplendent in gold-braided
uniforms, their chests a mass of decorations,
were politeness itself to all guests. Excellent
Persian bands, playing European airs, enlivened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-224" id="Pg_1-224"></a>[<a href="./images/1-224.png">224</a>]</span>
the evening, and it was quite interesting to meet
the rank and file and beauty of Teheran official
and commercial life all here assembled. Persian
ladies, naturally, did not appear, but a few
Armenian ladies of the better classes were to be
observed.</p>

<p>The gentle hint given to the guests to depart,
when the Prime Minister got tired and wanted
to retire, was quaintly clever. A soft music was
heard to come from his bedroom. It was the
signal. All hastened to make their best bows
and departed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> is told that one must not leave Teheran
without carefully inspecting the Shah's Palace,
its treasures and its museum. A special permit
must be obtained for this through the Legation
or the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>The first large court which I entered on this
second visit has pretty tiled buildings at the sides,
with its rectangular reservoir full of swans, and
bordered by trees, is probably the most impressive
part of the Palace. Fountains play in the
centre, the spouts being cast-iron women's heads
of the cheapest European kind.</p>

<p>The lofty throne hall stands at the end, its
decorative curtains screening its otherwise unwalled
frontage. For my special benefit the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-226" id="Pg_1-226"></a>[<a href="./images/1-226.png">226</a>]</span>
curtains were raised, leaving exposed the two
high spiral stone columns that support the roof
in front. The bases of these columns bore conventionalized
vases with sunflowers and leaf ornamentations,
while the capitols were in three
superposed fluted tiers, the uppermost being
the largest in diameter. The frieze of the ceiling
was concave, made of bits of looking-glass and
gold, and the ceiling itself was also entirely composed
of mirrors. The back was of shiny green
and blue, with eight stars and two large looking-glasses,
while at the sides there was a blue frieze.</p>

<p>Two large portraits of Nasr-ed-din Shah, two
battle scenes and two portraits of Fath-Ali-Shah
decorated the walls. The two side doors of the
throne-hall were of beautifully inlaid wood, and
the two doors directly behind the throne were
of old Shiraz work with ivory inscriptions upon
them in the centre. The lower part of the wall
was of coloured alabaster, with flower ornaments
and birds, principally hawks. There were also
other less important pictures, two of which I was
told represented Nadir and Mahmud Shah, and
two unidentified.</p>

<p>High up in the back wall were five windows,
of the usual Persian pattern, and also a cheap
gold frame enclosing a large canvas that represented
a half-naked figure of a woman with a
number of fowls, a cat and a dog. Two gold
<i>consoles</i> were the only heavy articles of movable
furniture to be seen.</p>

<p>The spacious throne of well-marked yellow
alabaster was quite gorgeous, and had two plat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-227" id="Pg_1-227"></a>[<a href="./images/1-227.png">227</a>]</span>forms,
the first, with a small fountain, being
reached by three steps, the second a step higher.
The platform was supported by demons, "guebre"
figures all round, and columns resting on
the backs of feline animals. On the upper platform
was spread an ancient carpet.</p>

<p>On leaving this hall we entered a second court
giving entrance to a building in the European
style, with a wide staircase leading to several
reception rooms on the first floor. One&mdash;the
largest&mdash;had a billiard table in the centre, expensive
furniture along the walls, and curtains of
glaring yellow and red plush, the chairs being
of the brightest blue velvet. Taken separately
each article of furniture was of the very best
kind, but it seemed evident that whoever furnished
that room did his utmost to select colours
that would not match.</p>

<p>There were two Parisian desks and a fine old
oak inlaid desk, a capital inlaid bureau, manufactured
by a Russian in Teheran, and some
Sultanabad carpets not more than fifty years old.
On the shelves and wherever else a place could
be found stood glass decorations of questionable
artistic taste, and many a vase with stiff bunches
of hideous artificial flowers.</p>

<p>Let us enter the adjoining Museum, a huge
room in five sections, as it were, each section having
a huge chandelier of white and blue Austrian
glass, suspended from the ceiling. There are glass
cases all round crammed full of things arranged
with no regard to their value, merit, shape, size,
colour or origin. Beautiful Chinese and Japanese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-228" id="Pg_1-228"></a>[<a href="./images/1-228.png">228</a>]</span>
<i>cloisonn&eacute;</i> stands next to the cheapest Vienna plaster
statuette representing an ugly child with huge
spectacles on his nose, and the most exquisite
S&egrave;vres and other priceless ceramic ware is grouped
with empty bottles and common glass restaurant
decanters. In company with these will be a
toy&mdash;a monkey automatically playing a fiddle.</p>

<p>Costly jade and cheap prints were together in
another case; copies of old paintings of saints and
the Virgin, coloured photographs of theatrical
and music-hall stars, and of picturesque scenery,
a painting of the Shah taken in his apartments,
jewels, gold ornaments inlaid with precious
stones, a beautiful malachite set consisting of
clock, inkstand, vases, and a pair of candlesticks;
meteoric stones and fossil shells&mdash;all were displayed
in the utmost confusion along the shelves.</p>

<p>At the further end of the Museum, reached
by three steps, was a gaudy throne chair of solid
gold and silver enamelled. The throne had
amphoras at the sides and a sunflower in diamonds
behind it. The seat was of red brocade,
and the chair had very small arms. It rested on
a six-legged platform with two supports and two
ugly candelabras.</p>

<p>A glance at the remaining glass cases of the
museum reveals the same confusion; everything
smothered in dust, everything uncared for. One's
eye detects at once a valuable set of china, and
some lovely axes, pistols and swords inlaid in
gold, ivory and silver. Then come busts of
Bismarck and Moltke, a plaster clown, tawdry
painted fans and tortoiseshell ones; a set of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-229" id="Pg_1-229"></a>[<a href="./images/1-229.png">229</a>]</span>
most common blue table-service, and two high
candelabras, green and white; a leather dressing-bag
with silver fittings (unused), automatic
musical figures, shilling candlesticks, artificial
coloured fruit in marble, and a really splendid
silver dinner-service.</p>

<p>From the Museum we passed into the <i>Atch</i>, a
kind of store-room, wherein were numberless
cigar-boxes, wicker-work baskets, and badly-kept
tiger skins. Here were photographs of
some of the Shah's favourites, a great assortment
of nut-crackers&mdash;the Persians love walnuts&mdash;cheap
prints in profusion, and some good
antelope-skins.</p>

<p>This led into the banqueting room, in the
European style&mdash;and quite a good, sober style
this time. The room was lighted by column
candelabras, and there was a collection of the
Shah's family portraits in medallions; also a
large-sized phonograph, which is said to afford
much amusement to His Majesty and his
guests.</p>

<p>The paintings on the walls ran very much to
the nude, and none were very remarkable, if one
excepts a life-size nude figure of a woman sitting
and in the act of caressing a dove. It is a very
clever copy of a painting by Foragne in the
Shah's picture gallery, and has been done by a
Persian artist named Kamaol-el-Mulk, who, I
was told, had studied in Paris.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all in the room, however,
was the exquisite old carpet with a delightful
design of roses. It was the carpet that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-230" id="Pg_1-230"></a>[<a href="./images/1-230.png">230</a>]</span>
Nasr-ed-din Shah brought to Europe with him
to spread under his chair.</p>

<p>The dining-room bore evident signs of His
Majesty's hasty departure for the country. On
the tables were piled up anyhow mountains of
dishes, plates, wine-glasses, and accessories, the
table service made in Europe being in most
excellent taste, white and gold with a small circle
in which the Persian "Lion and Sun" were
surmounted by the regal crown.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-25.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-25_th.jpg" alt="In the Shah's Palace Grounds, Teheran." title="In the Shah's Palace Grounds, Teheran." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">In the Shah's Palace Grounds, Teheran.</p>

<p>We go next into the Shah's favourite apartments,
where he spends most of his time when
in Teheran. We are now in the small room in
which I had already been received in audience
by his Majesty on his birthday, a room made
entirely of mirrors. There was a low and
luxurious red couch on the floor, and we trod on
magnificent soft silk carpets of lovely designs.
One could not resist feeling with one's fingers the
deliciously soft Kerman rug of a fascinating
artistic green, and a charming red carpet from
Sultanabad. The others came from Isfahan and
Kashan. The most valuable and beautiful of all,
however, was the white rug, made in Sultanabad,
on which the Shah stands when receiving in
audience.</p>

<p>Next after the carpets, a large clock by
Benson with no less than thirteen different dials,
which told one at a glance the year, the month,
the week, the day, the moon, the hour, minutes,
seconds, and anything else one might wish to
know, was perhaps the most noticeable item in
the Shah's room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-231" id="Pg_1-231"></a>[<a href="./images/1-231.png">231</a>]</span></p>

<p>There was nothing in the furniture to appeal to
one, the chairs and tables being of cheap bamboo
of the familiar folding pattern such as are
commonly characteristic of superior boarding-houses.
In the way of art there was a large
figure of a woman resting under a palm tree, a
photographic enlargement of the Shah's portrait,
and on the Shah's writing-desk two handsome
portraits of the Emperor and Empress of Russia,
the Emperor occupying the highest place of
honour. Two smaller photographs of the Czar
and Czarina were to be seen also in shilling
plush frames on another writing-desk, by the
side of an electric clock and night-light.</p>

<p>The eye was attracted by three terrestrial
globes and an astronomical one with constellations
standing on a table. A number of very
tawdry articles were lying about on the other
pieces of furniture; such were a metal dog
holding a ten-shilling watch, paper frames, cheap
imitation leather articles, numerous photographs
of the Shah, a copy of the <i>Petit Journal</i>
framed, and containing a representation of the
attempt on the Shah's life, an amber service, and
last, but not least, the nut-cracker and the
empty nutshells, the contents of which the Shah
was in process of eating when I had an audience
of him some days before, still lying undisturbed
upon a small desk. The Shah's special chair was
embroidered in red and blue.</p>

<p>All this was reflected myriads of times in the
diamond-shaped mirror ceiling and walls, and
the effect was somewhat dazzling. The room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-232" id="Pg_1-232"></a>[<a href="./images/1-232.png">232</a>]</span>
had a partition, and on the other side was an
ample couch for his Majesty to rest upon. In
each reception room is to be seen a splendid
grand piano, the music of which, when good,
the Shah is said passionately to enjoy. One of
his aides de camp&mdash;a European&mdash;is an excellent
pianist and composer.</p>

<p>We now come to the world-renowned "Jewelled-Globe"
room, and of course one makes at
once for the priceless globe enclosed in a glass
case in the centre of the room. The frame of
the large globe is said to be of solid gold and so
is the tripod stand, set in rubies and diamonds.
The Globe, to do justice to its name, is covered
all over with precious stones, the sea being
represented by green emeralds, and the continents
by rubies. The Equator line is set in
diamonds and also the whole area of Persian
territory.</p>

<p>There is nothing else of great artistic interest
here, and it depressed one to find that, although the
portraits in oil and photographs of the Emperors
of Russia and Austria occupied prominent places
of honour in the Shah's apartments, the only
image of our Queen Victoria was a wretched
faded cabinet photograph in a twopenny paper
frame, thrown carelessly among empty envelopes
and writing paper in a corner of his Majesty's
writing desk. Princess Beatrice's photograph
was near it, and towering above them in the
most prominent place was another picture of
the Emperor of Russia. We, ourselves, may
attach little meaning to these trifling details,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-233" id="Pg_1-233"></a>[<a href="./images/1-233.png">233</a>]</span>
but significant are the inferences drawn by the
natives themselves.</p>

<p>In this room, as in most of the others, there is
Bohemian glass in great profusion, and a "one
year chronometer" of great precision. A really
beautiful inlaid ivory table is disfigured by a
menagerie of coloured miniature leaden cats,
lions, lizards, dogs, a children's kaleidoscope, and
some badly-stuffed birds, singing automatically.
On another table were more glass vases and a
variety of articles made of cockle shells on
pasteboard, cycle watches, and brass rings with
imitation stones.</p>

<p>Adjoining this room is a small boudoir,
possessing the latest appliances of civilisation.
It contains another grand piano, a large apparatus
for projecting moving pictures on a screen, and
an ice-cream soda fountain with four taps, of
the type one admires&mdash;but does not wish to
possess&mdash;in the New York chemists' shops!!
The Shah's, however, lacks three things,&mdash;the
soda, the ice, and the syrups!</p>

<p>Less modern but more reposeful is the next ante-room
with white walls and pretty wood ceiling.
It has some military pictures of no great value.</p>

<p>On going down ten steps we find ourselves in
a long conservatory with blue and yellow tiles
and a semi-open roof. A channel of water runs
in the centre of the floor, and is the outlet of three
octagonal basins and of spouts at intervals of ten
feet. There is a profusion of lemon and orange
trees at the sides of the water, and the place is
kept deliciously cool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-234" id="Pg_1-234"></a>[<a href="./images/1-234.png">234</a>]</span></p>

<p>Here we emerge again into the gardens, which
are really beautiful although rather overcrowded,
but which have plenty of fountains and huge
tanks, with handsome buildings reflected into
the water.</p>

<p>The high tiled square towers, one of the
landmarks of Teheran, are quite picturesque,
but some of the pleasure of looking at the
really fine view is destroyed by numerous ugly
cast-iron coloured figures imported from Austria
which disfigure the sides of all the reservoirs,
and are quite out of keeping with the character
of everything round them.</p>

<p>We are now conducted into another building,
where Roman mosaics occupy a leading position,
a large one of the Coliseum being quite a valuable
work of art; but on entering the second
room we are suddenly confronted by a collection of
hideous tin ware and a specimen case of ordinary
fish hooks, manufactured by Messrs. W. Bartlett
and Sons. Next to this is a framed autograph
of "Nina de Muller of St. Petersburg," and a
photographic gathering of gay young ladies with
suitable inscriptions&mdash;apparently some of the late
Shah's acquaintances during his European tours.
Here are also stuffed owls, an automatic juggler,
an imitation snake, Japanese screens, and an
amusing painting by a Persian artist of Adam
and Eve in the Garden of Eden&mdash;the forbidden
fruit already missing.</p>

<p>Previous to entering the largest room we come
to an ante-room with photographs of scenery and
events belonging to the Shah's tour to Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-235" id="Pg_1-235"></a>[<a href="./images/1-235.png">235</a>]</span></p>

<p>In the large gold room the whole set of furniture,
I am told, was presented to Nasr-ed-din
Shah by the Sultan of Turkey, and there are,
besides, six large oil-paintings hanging upon the
walls in gorgeous gold frames. They represent
the last two Shahs, the Emperor and Empress
of Russia, the Crown Prince at the time of the
presentation, and the Emperor of Austria. A
smaller picture of Victor Emmanuel also occupies
a prominent place, but here again we have another
instance of the little reverence in which our
beloved Queen Victoria was held in the eyes of
the Persian Court. Among the various honoured
foreign Emperors and Kings, to whom this room
is dedicated, Queen Victoria's only representation
is a small, bad photograph, skied in the least
attractive part of the room&mdash;a most evident
slight, when we find such photographs as that of
the Emperor William occupying a front and
honoured place, as does also the photograph of
Queen Wilhelmina of Holland with her mother.
Yet another palpable instance of this disregard
for the reigning head of England appears in a
series of painted heads of Sovereigns. The Shah,
of course, is represented the biggest of the lot,
and King Humbert, Emperor William, the Sultan
of Turkey and the Emperor of Austria, of about
equal sizes; whereas the Queen of England is
quite small and insignificant.</p>

<p>The furniture in this room is covered with
the richest plush.</p>

<p>We now come upon the royal picture gallery
(or, rather, gallery of painted canvases), a long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-236" id="Pg_1-236"></a>[<a href="./images/1-236.png">236</a>]</span>
long room, where a most interesting display of
Persian, Afghan, Beluch and Turkish arms of all
kinds, ancient and modern, gold bows and arrows,
jewelled daggers, Damascus swords, are much
more attractive than the yards of portraits of
ladies who have dispensed altogether with
dressmakers' bills, and the gorgeously framed
advertisements of Brooks' Machine Cottons, and
other products, which are hung on the line in
the picture gallery! The pictures by Persian
art students&mdash;who paint in European style&mdash;are
rather quaint on account of the subjects chosen
when they attempt to be ideal. They run a
good deal to the fantastic, as in the case of the
several square yards of canvas entitled the "Result
of a dream." It contains quite a menagerie
of most suggestive wild animals, and dozens of
angels and demons in friendly intercourse playing
upon the surface of a lake and among the entangled
branches of trees. In the background
a pyrotechnic display of great magnitude is depicted,
with rockets shooting up in all directions,
while ethereal, large, black-eyed women lie gracefully
reclining and unconcerned, upon most unsafe
clouds. The result on the spectator of looking
at the "Result of a dream," and other similar
canvases by the same artist, is generally, I should
think, a nightmare.</p>

<p>There are some good paintings by foreign
artists, such as the life-size nude with a dove by
Folagne, which we have already seen, most
faithfully and cleverly copied by a Persian artist,
in the Shah's dining-room. Then there are some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-237" id="Pg_1-237"></a>[<a href="./images/1-237.png">237</a>]</span>
pretty Dutch and Italian pictures, but nothing
really first-rate in a purely artistic sense.</p>

<p>The cases of ancient and rare gold and silver
coins are, however, indeed worthy of remark,
and so are the really beautiful Persian, Afghan
and Turkish gold and silver inlaid shields, and
the intensely picturesque and finely ornamented
matchlocks and flintlocks. Here, too, as in
China, we find an abnormally large rifle&mdash;something
like the <i>gingal</i> of the Celestials. These
long clumsy rifles possess an ingenious back sight,
with tiny perforations at different heights of the
sight for the various distances on exactly the
principle of a Lyman back sight.</p>

<p>The Persians who accompanied me through
the Palace seemed very much astonished&mdash;almost
concerned&mdash;at my taking so much interest in
these weapons&mdash;which they said were only very
old and obsolete&mdash;and so little in the hideous
things which they valued and wanted me to
admire. They were most anxious that I should
stop before a box of pearls, a lot of them, all of
good size but not very regular in shape. Anything
worth big sums of money is ever much
more attractive to Persians (also, one might add,
to most Europeans) than are objects really artistic
or even pleasing to the eye.</p>

<p>Next to the pearls, came dilapidated butterflies
and shells and fossils and stuffed lizards and
crocodiles and elephants' tusks, and I do not
know what else, so that by the time one came
out, after passing through the confusion that
reigned everywhere, one's brain was so worn and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-238" id="Pg_1-238"></a>[<a href="./images/1-238.png">238</a>]</span>
jumpy that one was glad to sit and rest in the
lovely garden and sip cup after cup of tea,
which the Palace servants had been good enough
to prepare.</p>

<p>But there was one more thing that I was
dragged to see before departing&mdash;a modern
printing-press complete. His Majesty, when
the fancy takes him, has books translated and
specially printed for his own use. With a sigh
of relief I was glad to learn that I had now
seen everything, quite everything, in the Shah's
Palace!</p>

<p>The Shah has several country seats with
beautiful gardens on the hills to the north of
Teheran, where he spends most of the summer
months, and in these residences, too, we find the
rooms mostly decorated with mirrors, and differing
very little in character from those in the
Teheran Palace, only not quite so elaborate.
European influence has frequently crept in in
architectural details and interior decorations, but
not always advantageously.</p>

<p>The Andarun or harem, the women's quarter,
is generally less gaudy than the other buildings,
the separate little apartments belonging to each
lady being, in fact, quite modest and not always
particularly clean. There is very little furniture
in the bedrooms, Persian women having comparatively
few requirements. There is in addition
a large reception room, furnished in European
style, with elaborate coloured glass windows.
This room is used when the Shah visits the
ladies, or when they entertain friends, but there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-239" id="Pg_1-239"></a>[<a href="./images/1-239.png">239</a>]</span>
is nothing, it may be noted, to impress one with
the idea that these are regal residences or with
that truly oriental, gorgeous pomp, popularly associated
in Europe with the Shah's court. There
is probably no court of any importance where the
style of life is simpler and more modest than at
the Shah's. All the houses are, nevertheless,
most comfortable, and the gardens&mdash;the principal
feature of all these country places&mdash;extremely
handsome, with many fountains, tanks, and water
channels intersecting them in every direction
for the purpose of stimulating the artificially
reared vegetation, and also of rendering the
places cooler in summer.</p>

<p>Unlike most natives of the Asiatic continent,
the Persian shows no reluctance in accepting
foreign ways and inventions. He may lack the
means to indulge in foreign luxuries, but that is
a different matter altogether; the inclination to
reform and adopt European ways is there all the
same.</p>

<p>More forward in this line than most other
Persians is the Shah's son, a very intelligent,
bright young fellow, extremely plucky and
charmingly simple-minded. He takes the
keenest interest in the latest inventions and fads,
and, like his father the Shah, fell a victim to the
motor car mania. Only, the Shah entrusts his
life to the hands of an expert French driver,
whereas the young Prince finds it more amusing
to drive the machine himself. This, of course,
he can only do within the Palace grounds, since
to do so in the streets of the town would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-240" id="Pg_1-240"></a>[<a href="./images/1-240.png">240</a>]</span>
considered below his dignity and would shock
the people.</p>

<p>At the country residences he is said to have a
good deal of amusement out of his motor, but
not so the Shah's Ministers and friends who are
now terrified at the name "motor." The
young Prince, it appears, on the machine being
delivered from Europe insisted&mdash;without previous
knowledge of how to steer it&mdash;on driving it
round a large water tank. He invited several
stout Ministers in all their finery to accompany
him, which they did with beaming faces, overcome
by the honour. The machine started full
speed ahead in a somewhat snake-like fashion,
and with great destruction of the minor plants on
the way; then came a moment of fearful apprehension
on the part of spectators and performers
alike. The car collided violently with an old
tree; some of the high dignitaries were flung
into the water, others though still on dry land
lay flat on their backs.</p>

<p class="illc">The Shah and his Suite.</p>
<p class="figcenter">Prime Minister. General Kossakowski.</p>

<p>It speaks volumes for the young Prince's
pluck that, when the car was patched up, he
insisted on driving it again; but the number of
excuses and sudden complaints that have since
prevailed among his father's friends when asked
to go for a drive with the Prince are said to
be quite unprecedented.</p>

<p>The Prince is a great sportsman and much
beloved by all for his frankness and geniality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> much difficulty in obtaining a really
first-class servant, although many applied with
glowing certificates. It has always been my
experience that the more glowing the certificates
the worse the servant. For my particular kind
of travelling, too, a special type of servant
has to be got, with a constitution somewhat
above the average. I generally cover very great
distances at a high speed without the least
inconvenience to myself, but I find that those
who accompany me nearly always break down.</p>

<p>After inspecting a number of applicants I
fixed upon one man whose features showed
firmness of character and unusual determination.
He was a man of few words&mdash;one of the rarest
and best qualities in a travelling servant, and&mdash;he
had no relations dependent upon him&mdash;the
next best quality. He could shoot straight, he
could stick on a saddle, he could walk. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-242" id="Pg_1-242"></a>[<a href="./images/1-242.png">242</a>]</span>
required little sleep. He was willing to go to
any country where I chose to take him. He
required a high salary, but promised by all he
held most sacred that he would die before he
would give me the slightest trouble. This
seemed all fair, and I employed him.</p>

<p>Only one drawback did this man have&mdash;he
was an excellent European cook. I had to
modify him into a good plain cook, and then he
became perfection itself. His name was Sadek.</p>

<p>On October 2nd I was ready to start south.
My foot was still in a bad condition, but I
thought that the open air cure would be the
best instead of lying in stuffy rooms. Riding
is my favourite way of progression, but again it
was necessary to submit to another extortion
and travel by carriage as far as Kum on a road
made by the Bank of Persia some few years ago.
The speculation was not carried on sufficiently
long to become a success, and the road was
eventually sold to a Persian concern. The same
company runs a service of carriages with relays
of horses between the two places, and if one
wishes to travel fast one is compelled to hire a
carriage, the horses not being let out on hire for
riding purposes at any of the stations.</p>

<p>This time I hired a large diligence&mdash;the only
vehicle in the stables that seemed strong enough
to stand the journey. It was painted bright
yellow outside, had no windows, and was very
properly divided into two compartments, one
for men and one for women. The money for
the journey had to be paid in advance, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-243" id="Pg_1-243"></a>[<a href="./images/1-243.png">243</a>]</span>
vehicle was ordered to be at the door of the
hotel on Friday, October 4th, at 5.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span></p>

<p>It arrived on Sunday evening, October 6th,
at 6.30 o'clock. So much for Persian punctuality.
Sadek said I was lucky that it did come
so soon; sometimes the carriages ordered come
a week later than the appointed time; occasionally
they do not come at all!</p>

<p>Sadek, much to his disgust, was made to
occupy the ladies' compartment with all the
luggage, and I had the men's. We were off,
and left the city just in time before the South
Gate was closed. There were high hills to the
south-east, much broken and rugged, and to the
north beyond the town the higher ones above
Golahek, on which snow caps could be perceived.
Damovend (18,600 ft.), the highest and most
graceful mountain in Persia, stood with its white
summit against the sky to the north-east.</p>

<p>Even two hundred yards away from the city
gate there was nothing to tell us that we had
come out of the capital of Persia&mdash;the place
looks so insignificant from every side. A green-tiled
dome of no impressive proportions, a
minaret or two, and a few mud walls&mdash;that is
all one sees of the mass of houses one leaves
behind.</p>

<p>Barren country and dusty road, a graveyard
with its prism-shaped graves half-buried in sand,
are the attractions of the road. One comes to
an avenue of trees. Poor trees! How baked
and dried and smothered in dust! A couple of
miles off, we reached a patch of verdure and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-244" id="Pg_1-244"></a>[<a href="./images/1-244.png">244</a>]</span>
some really green trees and even signs of
agriculture. To our left (east) lay the narrow-gauge
railway line&mdash;the only one in Persia&mdash;leading
to the Shah-Abdul Azim mosque. The
whole length of the railway is not more than six
miles.</p>

<p>To the right of the road, some little distance
before reaching the mosque, a very quaint, large
high-relief has been sculptured on the face of
a huge rock and is reflected upside down in a
pond of water at its foot. Men were bathing here
in long red or blue drawers, and hundreds of
donkeys were conveying veiled women to this
spot. An enormous tree casts its shadow over
the pool of water in the forenoon.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-27.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-27_th.jpg" alt="Rock Sculpture near Shah-Abdul-Azim." title="Rock Sculpture near Shah-Abdul-Azim." /></a></p>

<p class="illc">Author's Diligence between Teheran and Kum.</p>

<p>It is interesting to climb up to the high-relief
to examine the figures more closely. The whole
sculpture is divided into three sections separated
by columns, the central section being as large as
the two side ones taken together. In the centre
is Fath-ali-shah&mdash;legless apparently&mdash;but supposed
to be seated on a throne. He wears a
high cap with three aigrettes, and his moustache
and beard are of abnormal length. In his belt at
the pinched waist he disports a sword and dagger,
while he holds a b&acirc;ton in his hand. There are
nine figures to his right in two rows: the Naib
Sultaneh, Hussein Ali, Taghi Mirza, above;
below, Mahommed, Ali Mirza, Fatali Mirza,
Abdullah Mirza, Bachme Mirza, one figure
unidentified. To the Shah's left the figures of
Ali-naghi Mirza and Veri Mirza are in the
lower row; Malek Mirza, the last figure to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-245" id="Pg_1-245"></a>[<a href="./images/1-245.png">245</a>]</span>
left, Hedar Mirza and Moh-Allah-Mirza next
to Fath-Ali-Shah. All the figures are long-bearded
and garbed in long gowns, with swords
and daggers. On Fath-Ali-Shah's right hand is
perched a hawk, and behind his throne stands an
attendant with a sunshade, while under the seat
are little figures of Muchul Mirza and Kameran
Mirza. There are inscriptions on the three
sides of the frame, but not on the base. A seat
is carved in the rock by the side of the sculpture.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards from this well-preserved
rock carving, a round tower 90 or 100 feet in
height has been erected. Its diameter inside is
about 40 feet and the thickness of the wall about
20 feet. It has two large yellow doors. Why
this purposeless structure was put up, nobody
seems to know for certain. One gets a beautiful
view from the top of the wall&mdash;Teheran in the
distance on one side; the Shah-Abdul-Azim
mosque on the other. Mountains are close by
to the east, and a patch of cultivation and a
garden all round down below. Near the
mosque&mdash;as is the case with all pilgrimage
places in Persia&mdash;we find a bazaar crammed
with beggars, black bag-like women riding
astride on donkeys or mules, depraved-looking
men, and stolid-looking Mullahs. There were
old men, blind men, lame men, deaf men,
armless men, men with enormous tumours, others
minus the nose or lower jaw&mdash;the result of
cancer. Millions of flies were buzzing about.</p>

<p>One of the most ghastly deformities I have
ever seen was a tumour under a Mullah's foot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-246" id="Pg_1-246"></a>[<a href="./images/1-246.png">246</a>]</span>
It was an almost spherical tumour, some three
inches in diameter, with skin drawn tight and
shining over its surface. It had patches of red
on the otherwise whitish-yellow skin, and gave
the impression of the man resting his foot on an
unripe water-melon with the toes half dug into
the tumour.</p>

<p>Non-Mussulmans are, of course, forbidden to
enter the mosque, so I had to be content with
the outside view of it&mdash;nothing very grand&mdash;and
must take my reader again along the flat,
uninteresting country towards Kum.</p>

<p>The usual troubles of semi-civilised Persia are
not lacking even at the very first stage. There
are no relays of horses, and those just unharnessed
are too tired to proceed. They are
very hungry, too, and there is nothing for them
to eat. Several hours are wasted, and Sadek
employs them in cooking my dinner and also in
giving exhibitions of his temper to the stable
people. Then follow endless discussions at the
top of their voices, in which I do not take part,
for I am old and wise enough not to discuss
anything with anybody.</p>

<p>The prospects of a backshish, the entreaties
and prayers being of no avail, Sadek flies into a
fury, rushes to the yard, seizes the horses and
harness, gives the coachman a hammering (and
the post master very nearly another), and so we
are able to start peacefully again at three <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
and leave Chah-herizek behind.</p>

<p>But the horses are tired and hungry. They
drag and stumble along in a most tiresome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-247" id="Pg_1-247"></a>[<a href="./images/1-247.png">247</a>]</span>
manner. There is moonlight, that ought to add
poetry to the scenery&mdash;but in Persia there is no
poetry about anything. There are a great many
caravans on the road&mdash;they all travel at night to
save the animals from the great heat of the day&mdash;long
strings of camels with their monotonous
bells, and dozens of donkeys or mules, some with
the covered double litters&mdash;the <i>kerjawa</i>. These
<i>kerjawas</i> are comfortable enough for people not
accustomed to ride, or for women who can sleep
comfortably while in motion inside the small
panier. The <i>kerjawa</i> is slung over the saddle
like two large hampers with a roof of bent bands
of wood. A cloth covering is made to turn
the <i>kerjawa</i> into a small private room, an exact
duplicate of which is slung on the opposite side
of the saddle. Two persons balancing each other
are required by this double arrangement, or one
person on one side and an equivalent quantity of
luggage on the other so as to establish a
complete balance&mdash;a most important point to
consider if serious accidents are to be avoided.</p>

<p>Every now and then the sleepy voice of a
caravan man calls out "Salameleko" to my
coachman, and "Salameleko" is duly answered
back; otherwise we rattle along at the speed of
about four miles an hour, bumping terribly on
the uneven road, and the diligence creaking in a
most perplexing manner.</p>

<p>At Hasanabad, the second stage, I was more
fortunate and got four good horses in exchange
for the tired ones. One of them was very fresh
and positively refused to go with the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-248" id="Pg_1-248"></a>[<a href="./images/1-248.png">248</a>]</span>
The driver, who was brutal, used his stock-whip
very freely, with the result that the horse
smashed part of the harness and bolted. The
other three, of course, did the same, and the
coachman was not able to hold them. We
travelled some few hundred yards off the road at
a considerable speed and with terrible bumping,
the shaky, patched-up carriage gradually beginning
to crumble to pieces. The boards of the
front part fell apart, owing to the violent
oscillations of the roof, and the roof itself
showed evident signs of an approaching collapse.
We were going down a steep incline, and I
cannot say that I felt particularly happy until
the horses were got under control again. I
feared that all my photographic plates and
cameras might get damaged if the diligence
turned over.</p>

<p>While the men mended the harness I had a
look at the scenery. The formation of the
country was curious. There were what at first
appeared to be hundreds of small mounds like
ant-hills&mdash;round topped and greyish, or in
patches of light brown, with yellow sand
deposits exposed to the air on the surface. On
getting nearer they appeared to be long flat-topped
ridges evidently formed by water-borne
matter&mdash;probably at the epoch when this was
the sea or lake bottom.</p>

<p>"<i>Khup es!</i>" (It is all right!) said the coachman,
inviting me to mount again&mdash;and in a
sudden outburst of exuberant affection he
embraced the naughty horse and kissed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-249" id="Pg_1-249"></a>[<a href="./images/1-249.png">249</a>]</span>
fondly on the nose. The animal reciprocated
the coachman's compliment by promptly kicking
the front splashboard of the carriage to
smithereens.</p>

<p>We crossed a bridge. To the east the water-level
mark, made when this valley was under
water, is plainly visible on the strata of gravel
with reddish mud above, of which the hills are
formed.</p>

<p>Then, rising gradually, the diligence goes
over a low pass and along a flat plateau separating
the first basin we have left behind from a
second, more extensive, of similar formation.
The hills in this second basin appear lower.
To the S.S.E. is a horseshoe-shaped sand dune,
much higher than anything we had so far
encountered, and beyond it a range of mountains.
Salt can be seen mixed with the pale-brownish
mud of the soil.</p>

<p>Then we drive across a third basin, large and
flat, with the scattered hills getting lower and
seemingly worn by the action of weather.
They are not so corrugated by water-formed
channels as the previous ones we had passed.
Twenty feet or so below the summit of the
hills a white sediment of salt showed itself
plainly.</p>

<p>The fourth basin is at a higher level than the
others&mdash;some 100 feet or so above the third&mdash;and
is absolutely flat, with dark, gravelly soil.</p>

<p>Azizawad village has no special attraction
beyond the protecting wall that encloses it&mdash;like
all villages of Persia&mdash;and the domed roofs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-250" id="Pg_1-250"></a>[<a href="./images/1-250.png">250</a>]</span>
of houses to which one begins to get reconciled.
Next to it is the very handsome fruit
garden of Khale-es-Sultan.</p>

<p>At Khale Mandelha the horses are changed.
The road becomes very undulating, with continuous
ups and downs, and occasional steep
ascents and descents. Glimpses of the large salt
lake, Daria-i-Nimak, or the Masileh, as it is also
called, are obtained, and eventually we had quite
a pretty view with high blue mountains in the
background and rocky black mounds between
the spectator and the silvery sheet of water.</p>

<p>Aliabad has a large caravanserai with a red-columned
portico to the east; also a special
place for the Sadrazam, the Prime Minister,
when travelling on this road; a garden with
a few sickly trees, and that is all.</p>

<p>On leaving the caravanserai one skirts the
mountain side to the west, and goes up it to the
horse station situated in a most desolate spot.
From this point one gets a bird's-eye view of
the whole lake. Its waters, owing to evaporation,
seem to withdraw, leaving a white sediment
of salt along the edge. The road from the
Khafe-khana runs now in a perfectly straight line
S.W., and, with the exception of the first short
incline, is afterwards quite flat, passing along and
very little above the lake shore, from which the
road is about one mile distant. The lake is to
the S.E. of the road at this point. To the
S.W., W., N.W., N., lies a long row of dark-brown
hills which circle round the valley we
are about to cross.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-251" id="Pg_1-251"></a>[<a href="./images/1-251.png">251</a>]</span></p>

<p>The sunset on that particular night was one
in which an amateur painter would have revelled.
A dirty-brown foreground as flat as a billiard-table&mdash;a
sharp cutting edge of blue hill-tops
against a bilious lemon-yellow sky blending into
a ghastly cinabrese red, which gradually vanished
into a sort of lead blue. There are few
countries where the sun appears and disappears
above and from the earth's surface with less glow
than in Persia. Of course, the lack of moisture
in the atmosphere largely accounts for this.
During the several months I was in the country&mdash;though
for all I know this may have been
my misfortune only&mdash;I never saw more than
half a dozen sunsets that were really worth
intense admiration, and these were not in
Western Persia. The usual sunsets are effects
of a washed-out sort, with no force and no
beautiful contrasts of lights and colours such as
one sees in Egypt, in Morocco, in Spain, Italy,
or even, with some amount of toning down, in
our little England.</p>

<p>The twilight in Persia is extremely short.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a deserted road, sleepy and shaken, with
the wind blowing so hard that it tore and carried
away all the cotton curtains of the carriage, I
arrived at Kum (3,200 feet above sea level) in
the middle of the night. The distance covered
between Teheran and Kum was twenty-four
farsakhs, or ninety-six miles.</p>

<p>As we approached the holy city there
appeared to be a lot of vegetation around, and
Sadek and the coachman assured me that this
was a region where pomegranates were grown in
profusion, and the castor-oil plant, too. Cotton
was, moreover, cultivated with success.</p>

<p>Kum is, to my mind, and apart from its
holiness, one of the few really picturesque cities
of Persia. I caught the first panoramic glimpse
of the shrine and mosque at sunrise from the
roof of the post house, and was much impressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-253" id="Pg_1-253"></a>[<a href="./images/1-253.png">253</a>]</span>
by its grandeur. Amidst a mass of semi-spherical
mud roofs, and beyond long mud walls,
rise the gigantic gilded dome of the mosque,
two high minarets, and two shorter ones with
most beautifully coloured tiles inlaid upon their
walls, the general effect of which is of most
delicate greys, blues and greens. Then clusters
of fruit trees, numerous little minarets all over
the place, and ventilating shafts above the better
buildings break the monotony agreeably.</p>

<p>Kum, I need hardly mention, is one of the
great pilgrimages of Mahommedans. Happy
dies the man or woman whose body will be laid
at rest near the sacred shrine, wherein&mdash;it is
said&mdash;lie the remains of Matsuma Fatima.
Corpses are conveyed here from all parts of the
country. Even kings and royal personages are
buried in the immediate neighbourhood of the
shrine. Round the city there are thousands of
mud graves, which give quite a mournful appearance
to the holy city. There are almost as
many dead people as living ones in Kum!</p>

<p>Innumerable Mullahs are found here who are
very conservative, and who seem to resent the
presence of European visitors in the city.
Access to the shrine is absolutely forbidden to
foreigners.</p>

<p>Immense sums of money are brought daily to
the holy city by credulous pilgrims, but no
outward signs of a prosperous trade nor of fine
streets or handsome private buildings can be
detected on inspecting the bazaar or streets of
the town. On the contrary, the greater part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-254" id="Pg_1-254"></a>[<a href="./images/1-254.png">254</a>]</span>
the residences are in a hopeless state of decay,
and the majority of the inhabitants, to all
appearance, little above begging point.</p>

<p>Leather, tanned with the bark of the pomegranate,
and cheap pottery are the chief industries
of the holy city. On inquiring what becomes
of all the wealth that comes into the town, a
Persian, with a significant gesture, informed me
that the Mullahs get it and with them it
remains.</p>

<p>The handsome dome over the shrine was begun
by order of Hussein Nadir Shah, but the
gorgeous gilding of the copper plates was not
finished till a few years ago by Nasr-ed-din
Shah. A theological college also exists at this
place. There is a station here of the Indo-European
Telegraphs, with an Armenian in
charge of it.</p>

<p>Much to my disgust, I was informed that the
owner of the post-house had the monopoly of
the traffic on the track for six or seven farsakhs
more, and so travellers were compelled to submit
to a further extortion by having to hire another
wheeled conveyance instead of being able to
ride. This time I chartered a victoria, and off
we went as usual at a gallop.</p>

<p>Two horses had to be sent ahead while the
carriage was driven with only two animals
through the narrow streets of the bazaar, covered
over with awnings or with domed perforated
roofs. The place had a tawdry, miserable
appearance, the leather shops being the only
interesting ones, with the many elaborate saddles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-255" id="Pg_1-255"></a>[<a href="./images/1-255.png">255</a>]</span>
harness, saddle-bags, and horses' ornamentations
displayed on nails along the walls.</p>

<p>I saw in a blacksmith's shop an ingenious
device to create a perpetual draught with
bellows. The big bellows were double and
allowed sufficient room to let two boys stand
between the two. The boys clinging to handles
in the upper part of the bellows and using the
weight of their bodies now to the right, then to
the left, inflated first one then the other, the
wind of each bellow passing through a common
end tube and each being in turn refilled with
air while the other was blowing. This human
pendulum arrangement was carried on with
incredible rapidity by the two boys, who dashed
their bodies from one side to the other and
back, keeping steady time and holding their
feet stationary, but describing an almost complete
semicircle with the remainder of the
body, the whole length of the boy forming
the radius.</p>

<p>There was a shop or two where glass was
being blown, and numerous fruit-shops with
mountains of pomegranates, water-melons and
grapes. At the entrance of the mosques crowds
of people stood waiting for admission, some
praying outside.</p>

<p>Once out of the town the extra two horses,
which were waiting at the gate, were harnessed,
and as we sped along, the lungs rejoiced in the
pure air of which the stuffy, cellar-like bazaar
had afforded none.</p>

<p>Behind, in the far distance, Damovend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-256" id="Pg_1-256"></a>[<a href="./images/1-256.png">256</a>]</span>
Mountain, covered with snow, could still be
seen rising high above everything. It was undoubtedly
a good-looking mountain. To the
south-west and west lay indented hills of the
most curious shapes and colours&mdash;one, particularly,
like a roof, with a greenish base surmounted
by a raw-sienna top; a twin-sister hill
further west presented the same peculiarities.
In the distant mountains to the west the same
characteristics were apparent, the greenish
stratum below extending all along and increasing
in depth towards the south.</p>

<p>The road&mdash;if one may call it so&mdash;was
extremely bad and hardly fit for wheeled traffic.
After leaving Kum the vegetation ceased, and
it was only at Langherut village that a patch of
green refreshed the eye.</p>

<p>A few strolling wayfarers crowded round
when the carriage stopped to give the horses a
rest under the shade of a tree, and Sadek was
cross-examined about the Sahib whom he was
accompanying. It was quite amusing to hear
one's self and one's doings commented upon in
the most open manner, regardless of one's
personal feelings, which are better discarded
altogether while travelling in Persia. There is
absolutely nothing private in the land of Iran.
One's appearance, one's clothes, the quantity of
food one eats, the amount of money one carries,
where one comes from and where one goes,
whom one knows, one's servants, one's rifles,
one's cameras,&mdash;everything is remarked upon,
as if one were not present. If one possesses no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-257" id="Pg_1-257"></a>[<a href="./images/1-257.png">257</a>]</span>
false pride and a sense of humour, a deal of
entertainment is thus provided on the road.</p>

<p>Passangun could be perceived in the distance,
and a dreary, desolate place it was when one
got there. In the way of architecture, we found
a large tumbling-down caravanserai, a tea-shop,
and the Chappar Khana (the post-house). As
to vegetation, thirteen sickly trees, all counted.
Barren, uninteresting country surrounded the
halting place.</p>

<p>I spent here a pleasant hour while waiting for
my luggage to arrive on pack animals. A
caravan of some fifty horses and mules had
halted at sunset, and a number of pilgrims, with
beards dyed bright-red, were making their
evening salaams towards Mecca. Having
removed shoes and duly washed their feet and
hands, they stood erect on the projecting
platform of the caravanserai, and after considerable
adjusting of caps and head-scratching,
assumed a meditative attitude, head bent forward,
and muttered prayers with hands down. Then
the hands were raised flat before the face, with
a bow. Kneeling followed, with hands first
resting on the knees, then raised again to cover
the face, after which, with the palms of the
hands resting flat on the ground, the head was
brought down until it touched the ground too.
A standing position was further assumed, when
the temples were touched with the thumb while
prayers were recited, and then the petitioners
stooped low and fell a second time on their knees,
saying the beads of their rosaries. The forehead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-258" id="Pg_1-258"></a>[<a href="./images/1-258.png">258</a>]</span>
was made to touch the ground several times
before the evening prayers were over.</p>

<p>Next, food was cooked in the small fire places
of the caravanserai, and tea brewed in large quantities.
The inevitable kalian was called for, and
the caravanserai boy brought out his interesting
little arrangement to set charcoal quickly alight
for the large cup of the kalian. To a string
three feet long, hung a small perforated iron cup,
which he filled with charcoal, one tiny bit being
already alight. By quickly revolving the contrivance
as one would a sling, the draught forced
through the apertures in the cup produced quick
combustion, and charcoal was at once distributed
alight among the kalians of the impatient guests.</p>

<p>Much amusement and excitement was caused
among the pilgrims by a fight between a puppy-dog
and five or six small goats. Only one of
these at a time fought the dog, while the others
occupied a high point of vantage on which they
had hastily climbed, and from that place of
security displayed a keen interest in the fight.</p>

<p>The water at Passangun was extremely bad.
There were two tanks of rain water drained from
the hillside along a dirty channel filled with
animal refuse. The wells were below the ground
level, and were walled and domed over to
prevent too rapid an evaporation by the sun's
rays. The water was pestilential. It had a
nasty green look about it, and patches of putrid
matter decomposing visibly on its surface. The
stench from it when stirred was sickening. Yet
the natives drank it and found it all right!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-259" id="Pg_1-259"></a>[<a href="./images/1-259.png">259</a>]</span>
There is no accounting for people's taste, not
even in Persia.</p>

<p>At last, from this point, the positive torture of
driving in carriages was over, and <i>Chappar</i> horses
were to be obtained. The saddles were got
ready, and with five horses we made a start that
same evening for Sin Sin. After the wretched
bumping and thumping and being thrown about
in the wheeled conveyance on the badly-kept
road, it seemed heavenly to be ambling along at
a fairly good pace, even on these poor, half-starved
animals, which could not in all honesty
be considered to afford perfect riding. Indeed,
if there ever was a society for the prevention of
cruelty to animals, it should have begun its work
along the Persian postal roads. The poor brutes&mdash;one
can hardly call them horses&mdash;are bony
and starved, with sore backs, chests and legs,
with a bleeding tongue almost cut in two and
pitifully swollen by cruelly-shaped bits, and endowed
with stinking digestive organs and other
nauseous odours of uncared-for sores heated by
the friction of never-removed, clumsy, heavy
pads under the saddles. It requires a pretty
strong stomach, I can tell you, to ride them at
all. Yet the poor devils canter along, when they
do not amble, and occasionally gallop clumsily
on their unsteady, skeleton-like legs. So that,
notwithstanding everything, one generally manages
to go at the rate of six or seven miles an
hour.</p>

<p>If the horses at the various post-stations have
just returned from conveying the post-bags, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-260" id="Pg_1-260"></a>[<a href="./images/1-260.png">260</a>]</span>
extra sorry time is in store for the traveller.
The poor animals are then so tired that they
occasionally collapse on the road. I invariably
used all the kindness I could to these wretches,
but it was necessary for me to get on, as I
intended to proceed in the greatest haste over
the better known parts of Persia.</p>

<p>It is important to see the horses fed before
starting from all the post-houses, but on many
occasions no food whatever could be procured
for them, when, of course, they had to go
without it.</p>

<p>Changing horses about every 20 to 28 miles,
and being on the saddle from fourteen to twenty
hours out of the twenty-four, I was able to cover
long distances, and kept up an average of from
80 to 120 miles daily. One can, of course,
cover much greater distances than these in one
day, if one is fortunate enough to get good and
fresh horses at the various stations, and if one
does not have to keep it up for a long period of
time as I had to do.</p>

<p>From Sin Sin we go due south along a flat
trail of salt and mud. We have a barrier
of mountains to the south-west and higher
mountains to the south. To the south-east also
a low ridge with another higher behind it. To
the north we leave behind low hills.</p>

<p>Sin Sin itself is renowned for its water-melons,
and I, too, can humbly certify to their excellence.
I took a load of them away for the journey.</p>

<p>From here we began to see the wonderful
effects of deceitful mirage, extremely common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-261" id="Pg_1-261"></a>[<a href="./images/1-261.png">261</a>]</span>
all over Persia. One sees beautiful lakes of
silvery water, with clusters of trees and islands
and rocks duly reflected upside down in their
steady waters, but it is all an optical deception,
caused by the action of the heated soil on the
expanding air immediately in contact with it,
which, seen from above and at a distance, is of a
bluish white tint with exactly the appearance
and the mirror-like qualities of still water.</p>

<p>Although in Central Persia one sees many of
these effects every day, they are sometimes so
marvellous that even the most experienced
would be deceived.</p>

<p>The country is barren and desolate. Kasimabad
has but two buildings, both caravanserais;
but Nassirabad, further on, is quite a large
village, with domed roofs and a couple of
minarets. On the road is a large caravanserai,
with the usual alcoves all round its massive
walls. Except the nice avenue of trees along a
refreshing brook of limpid water, there was
nothing to detain us here but the collision
between one of my pack-horses and a mule of a
passing caravan, with disastrous results to both
animals' loads. But, with the assistance of one
or two natives commandeered by Sadek, the
luggage scattered upon the road was replaced
high on the saddles, the fastening ropes were
pulled tight by Sadek with his teeth and hands,
while I took this opportunity to sit on the roadside
to partake of my lunch&mdash;four boiled eggs, a
cold roast chicken, Persian bread, some cake,
and half a water-melon, the whole washed down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-262" id="Pg_1-262"></a>[<a href="./images/1-262.png">262</a>]</span>
with a long drink of clear water. Riding at the
rate I did, the whole day and the greater part of
the night, in the hot sun and the cold winds at
night, gave one a healthy appetite.</p>

<p>As we got nearer Kashan city, the villages got
more numerous; Aliabad and the Yaze (mosque)
and Nushabad to my left (east), with its blue tiled
roof of the mosque. But the villages were so
very much alike and uninteresting in colour and
in architecture, that a description of each would
be unimportant and most tedious, so that I will
only limit myself to describing the more typical
and striking ones with special features that may
interest the reader.</p>

<p>In the morning of October 9th I had reached
the city of Kashan, seventeen farsakhs (sixty-eight
miles) from Kum, and forty-one farsakhs
or 164 miles from Teheran, in two days and a
half including halts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kashan</span>, 3,260 feet above sea level, is famous
for its gigantic and poisonous scorpions, for its
unbearable heat, its capital silk works, and its
copper utensils, which, if not always ornamental,
are proclaimed everlasting. The silk manufactories
are said to number over three hundred,
including some that make silk carpets, of world-wide
renown. The population is 75,000 souls or
thereabouts. Nothing is ever certain in Persia.
There are no hotels in the city, and it is considered
undignified for Europeans to go to a caravanserai&mdash;of
which there are some three dozen in
Kashan&mdash;or to the Chappar Khana.</p>

<p>The Indo-European Telegraphs have a large
two-storied building outside the north gate of
the city, in charge of an Armenian clerk, where,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-264" id="Pg_1-264"></a>[<a href="./images/1-264.png">264</a>]</span>
through the courtesy of the Director of Telegraphs,
travellers are allowed to put up, and
where the guests' room is nice and clean, with a
useful bedstead, washstand, and a chair or two.</p>

<p>A capital view of Kashan is obtained from the
roof of the Telegraph building. A wide road,
the one by which I had arrived, continues to the
north-east entrance of the bazaar. The town
itself is divided into two sections&mdash;the city
proper, surrounded by a high wall, and the
suburbs outside. To the south-west, in the town
proper, rises the slender tower of Zein-ed-din,
slightly over 100 feet high, and not unlike a
factory chimney. Further away in the distance&mdash;outside
the city&mdash;the mosque of Taj-ed-din
with its blue pointed roof, adjoins the famous
Meh-rab shrine, from which all the most ancient
and beautiful tiles have been stolen or sold by
avid Mullahs for export to Europe.</p>

<p>Then we see the two domes of the mosque
and theological college, the Madrassah Shah,
where young future Mullahs are educated. To
the west of the observer from our high point of
vantage, and north-west of the town, lies another
mosque, the Panja Shah, in which the hand of
one of the prophets, Nazareth Abbas, is buried.
A life-size hand and portion of the forearm,
most beautifully carved in marble, is shown to
devotees in a receptacle in the east wall of the
mosque. The actual grave in which the real
hand lies is covered with magnificent ancient
tiles.</p>

<p>It is with a certain amount of sadness that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-265" id="Pg_1-265"></a>[<a href="./images/1-265.png">265</a>]</span>
one gazes on the old Fin Palace, up on the hills
some six miles to the west, and listens to the
pathetic and repellent tragedy which took place
within its garden walls.</p>

<p>The square garden is surrounded by a high
wall, and has buildings on three sides. Marble
canals, fed by large marble tanks, in which run
streams of limpid water, intersect the garden in
the middle of a wide avenue of dark cypresses.
The garden was commenced by Shah Abbas.
The Palace, however, was built by Fath-Ali-Shah,
who also much improved the gardens and
made this a favourite residence during the hot
summer months.</p>

<p>There is here a very hot natural spring of
sulphur water, and copper, which is said to
possess remarkable curative qualities, especially
for rheumatism and diseases of the blood. One
bath is provided for men and another for
women.</p>

<p>The Palace, with its quaint pictures and
decorations is now in a state of abandonment
and semi-collapse. The tragic end (in 1863 or
1864, I could not clearly ascertain which) at
this place of Mirza-Taki Khan, then Prime
Minister of Persia&mdash;as honest and straightforward
a politician as Persia has ever possessed&mdash;adds
a peculiar gloom to the place.</p>

<p>A man of humble birth, but of great genius,
Mirza-Taki Khan, rose to occupy, next to the
Shah, the highest political position in his
country, and attempted to place the Government
of Persia on a firm basis, and to eradicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-266" id="Pg_1-266"></a>[<a href="./images/1-266.png">266</a>]</span>
intrigue and corruption. To this day his
popularity is proverbial among the lower classes,
by whom he is still revered and respected for his
uprightness. The Shah gave him his only sister
in marriage, but unhappily one fine day his
enemies gained the upper hand at Court. He
fell into disgrace, and was banished to Kashan to
the Fin Palace. Executioners were immediately
sent to murder him by order of the Shah.
Mirza-Taki Khan, when their arrival was
announced, understood that his end had come.
He asked leave to commit suicide instead, which
he did by having the arteries of his arms cut
open. He bled to death while in his bath.</p>

<p>Royal regret at the irreparable loss was
expressed, but it was too late. The body of the
cleverest statesman Persia had produced was
conveyed for burial to the Sanctuary of Karbala.</p>

<p>One cannot help being struck, in a stifling
hot place like Kashan, to find large ice store-houses.
Yet plenty of ice is to be got here
during the winter, especially from the mountains
close at hand. These ice-houses have a pit dug
in the ground to a considerable depth, and are
covered over with a high conical roof of mud.
To the north-east, outside the city, in the
suburbs a great many of these ice store-houses
are to be seen, as well as a small, blue-tiled roof
of a mosque, the pilgrimage of Habbib-Mussah.</p>

<p>There is some cultivation round about Kashan,
principally of cotton, tobacco, melons and water-melons,
which one sees in large patches <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'whereever'">wherever</ins>
there is water obtainable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-267" id="Pg_1-267"></a>[<a href="./images/1-267.png">267</a>]</span></p>

<p>Kashan is protected by mountains to the
south and west, and by low hills to the north-west,
but to the north and north-east the eye
roams uninterrupted over an open, flat, dusty,
dreary plain of a light brown colour until it
meets the sky line on the horizon, softly dimmed
by a thick veil of disturbed sand. Due east lie
the Siah Kuh (mountains), then comes another
gap in the horizon to the south-east.</p>

<p>In the dark and gloomy bazaar the din of
hundreds of wooden hammers on as many
pieces of copper being made into jugs, trays, pots
or pans, is simply deafening, echoed as it is
under the vaulted roofs, the sound waves clashing
in such an unmusical and confused way as to be
absolutely diabolical. A few of these copper
vessels are gracefully ornamented and inlaid, but
the majority are coarse in their manufacture.
They are exported all over the country. The
manufactured silk, the other important product
of Kashan, finds its way principally to Russia.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are most industrious and,
like all industrious people, are extremely docile,
amenable to reason, and easy to manage. The
Mullahs are said to have much power over the
population, and, in fact, we find in Kashan no
less than 18 mosques with five times that
number of shrines, counting large and small.</p>

<p>I experienced some difficulty in obtaining
relays of fresh post horses, the mail having been
despatched both north and south the previous
night, and therefore no horses were in the
station. At seven in the evening I was informed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-268" id="Pg_1-268"></a>[<a href="./images/1-268.png">268</a>]</span>
that five horses had returned and were at my
disposal. Twenty minutes later the loads were
on their saddles, and I was on the road again.</p>

<p>After travelling under the pitch-dark vaulted
bazaars (where, as it was impossible to see where
one was going, the horses had to be led), and
threading our way out of the suburbs, we
travelled on the flat for some time before coming
to the hilly portion of the road where it winds
its way up at quite a perceptible gradient. We
had no end of small accidents and trouble. The
horses were half-dead with fatigue. They had
gone 48 miles already with the post, and without
rest or food had been sent on with me for 28
more miles! The poor wretches collapsed
time after time on the road under their loads,
although these were very light, and my servant
and I and the chappar boy had to walk the
whole way and drag the animals behind us, for
they had not sufficient strength to carry us.
Even then their knees gave way every now and
then, and it was no easy job to get them to
stand up again. One of them never did. He
died, and, naturally, we had to abandon him.</p>

<p>It came on to blow very hard, and with the
horses collapsing on all sides and the loads
getting constantly undone owing to the repeated
falls of the animals, we could not cover more
than one mile, or two, an hour. Caravans
generally take the road over these mountains
during the day, so that now the road was quite
deserted and we could get no assistance from
any one. The loss of one horse increased our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-269" id="Pg_1-269"></a>[<a href="./images/1-269.png">269</a>]</span>
difficulty, as it involved putting more weight on
the other horses.</p>

<p>At 3.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we managed to reach the caravanserai
in the mountains at Gyabrabat (Gabarabat),
the sight of which was enough to settle all
the horses. They one and all threw themselves
down on reaching the door, and it was not
possible to make them stand again. To continue
the journey to Kohrut (Kohrud) through the
night, as I had intended, was absolutely out of
the question, so we roused the keeper of the
hostelry and demanded admission.</p>

<p>The man was extremely uncivil, as he said he
had some grievance against a previous English
traveller, but on being assured that I would pay
with my own hands for all I got and not through
servants&mdash;a rule which I always follow, and
which saves much unpleasantness and unfair
criticism from the natives&mdash;he provided me with
all I required. First of all I fed the horses.
Then Sadek cooked me a capital supper. Then
I gave the horses and myself some four hours
rest&mdash;that refreshed us all very much.</p>

<p>The caravanserai was filthy. All the small
rooms and alcoves were occupied, and I preferred
to sleep out in the yard, sheltered from the
wind behind the huge doorway. I had with me
some boxes of my own invention and manufacture,
which had accompanied me on several
previous journeys, and which, besides a number
of other purposes, can serve as a bedstead.
They came in very usefully on that particular
occasion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-270" id="Pg_1-270"></a>[<a href="./images/1-270.png">270</a>]</span></p>

<p>From Gyabrabad to Kohrut the region is
supposed to be a famous haunt of robbers.
Undoubtedly the country lends itself to that
kind of enterprise, being mountainous and much
broken up, so that the occupation can be carried
on with practical impunity. The road is
among rocks and boulders. Although there are
no very great elevations in the mountains on
either side, the scenery is picturesque, with black-looking
rocky slopes, at the bottom of which a
tiny and beautifully limpid stream descends
towards Kashan. The track is mostly along this
stream.</p>

<p class="illc">Between Gyabrabad and Kohrut.</p>

<p>After a steep, stony incline of some length,
half-way between Gyabrabad and the Kohrut
pass, one comes across a high and well-made
dam, the work of a speculator. In winter and
during the rains the water of the stream is shut
up here into a large reservoir, a high wall being
built across the two mountain slopes, and
forming a large lake. The water is then sold to
the city of Kashan. If in due course of time
the purchase-money is not forthcoming, the
supply is cut off altogether by blocking up the
small aperture in the dam&mdash;which lets out the
tiny stream the course of which we have been
following upwards.</p>

<p>The Persian post-horse is a most wonderful
animal. His endurance and powers of recovery
are simply extraordinary. Having been properly
fed, and enjoyed the few hours' rest, the animals,
notwithstanding their wretched condition and
the bad road, went fairly well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-271" id="Pg_1-271"></a>[<a href="./images/1-271.png">271</a>]</span></p>

<p>On nearing Kohrut one is agreeably surprised
to find among these barren mountains healthy
patches of agriculture and beautiful groves of
fruit-trees. The fruit is excellent here,&mdash;apples,
plums, apricots, walnuts, and the Kohrut potatoes
are said (by the people of Kohrut) to be the best
in the world. The most remarkable thing about
these patches of cultivation is that the soil in
which they occur has been brought there&mdash;the
mountain itself being rocky&mdash;and the imported
earth is supported by means of strong stone walls
forming long terraces. This speaks very highly
for the industry of the natives, who are extremely
hardworking. We go through these
delightful groves for nearly one mile, when
suddenly we find ourselves in front of Kohrut
village, most picturesquely perched on the steep
slope of the mountain.</p>

<p>The houses are of an absolutely different
type from the characteristically domed Persian
hovels one has so far come across. They have
several storeys, two or even three&mdash;an extremely
rare occurrence in Persian habitations. The
lower windows are very small, like slits in the
wall, but the top windows are large and square,
usually with some lattice woodwork in front of
them. The domed roofs have been discarded,
owing to the quantity of wood obtainable here,
and the roofs are flat and thatched, supported on
long projecting beams and rafters. Just before
entering the village a great number of ancient
graves can be seen dotted on the mountain-side,
and along the road. The view of the place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-272" id="Pg_1-272"></a>[<a href="./images/1-272.png">272</a>]</span>
with its beautiful background of weird mountains,
and the positions of the houses, the door
of one on the level with the roof of the underlying
one, against the face of the rock, are
most striking.</p>

<p class="illc">The Interior of Chappar Khana at Kohrut.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this village are quite polite
and friendly, and lack the usual aggressiveness so
common at all the halting places in Persia.</p>

<p>Fresh horses were obtained at the Chappar
Khana, and I proceeded on my journey at once.
We still wound our way among mountains going
higher and higher, until we got over the Kuh-i-buhlan
(the pass). From the highest point a
lovely view of the valley over which we had
come from the north-west displayed itself in
dark brown tints, and to the east we had a
mass of barren mountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not till after sunset that we crossed the
Pass, and, the horses being tired, my men and I
were walking down the incline on the other side
to give the animals a rest. It was getting quite
dark, and as the chappar boy had warned me
that there were brigands about the neighbourhood
I walked close to my horse, my revolver
being slung to the saddle. The place seemed
absolutely deserted, and I was just thinking how
still and reposeful the evening seemed, the noise
of the horses' hoofs being the only disturbing
element amid quiescent nature, when suddenly
from behind innocent-looking rocks and boulders
leapt up, on both sides of the road, about a dozen
well-armed robbers, who attempted to seize the
horses. Before they had time to put up their
rifles they found themselves covered by my revolver
and requested to drop their weapons or I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-274" id="Pg_1-274"></a>[<a href="./images/1-274.png">274</a>]</span>
would shoot them. They hastily complied with
my request, and instead of ransacking my baggage,
as they had evidently designed to do, had
to confine themselves to polite remarks.</p>

<p>"You are very late on the road, sahib?" said
one brigand, in a voice of assumed kindness and
softness.</p>

<p>"Please put back your revolver. We will not
harm you," said suavely and persuasively another,
who displayed a most gaudy waistcoat which he
evidently did not want perforated.</p>

<p>Sadek was in a great state of excitement, and
entreated me not to shoot. "Persian robbers,"
he assured me, with a logic of his own, "do not
kill the master until the servant has been killed,
because it is the servant who is in charge of the
luggage. . . . . They would not steal anything
now, but I must be kind to these fellows."</p>

<p>As is usual with persons accustomed to stalk
other persons, I did not fail to notice that, while
trying to attract my attention by conversation,
my interlocutors were endeavouring to surround
us. But I checked them in this, and warned
them that I had met many brigands before, and
was well acquainted with their ways. I hoped
they would not compel me to shoot, which I
would most certainly do if they attempted any
tricks. They well understood that it was risky
to try their luck, so they changed tactics altogether.
The conversation that ensued was
amusing.</p>

<p>"Sahib," shouted a boisterous robber, very
gaily attired, and with cartridges in profusion in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-275" id="Pg_1-275"></a>[<a href="./images/1-275.png">275</a>]</span>
his belt, "there are lots of brigands near here
and we want to protect you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know there are brigands not far from
here," I assented.</p>

<p>"We will escort you, for you are our friend,
and if we lead you safely out of the mountains,
maybe, sahib, you will give us backshish."</p>

<p>I felt certain that I could have no better protection
against brigands than the brigands themselves,
and preferred to have them under my
own supervision rather than give them a chance
of attacking us unexpectedly again some miles
further on. Anyhow, I resolved to let them
come as far as the next pass we had to cross,
from which point the country would be more
open and a sudden surprise impossible. So I
accepted their offer with a politely expressed
condition that every man must keep in front of
me and not raise his rifle above his waist or I
would send a bullet through him.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night we parted on the
summit of the pass, and I gave them a good
backshish&mdash;not so much for the service they
had rendered me as for relieving for a few hours
the monotony of the journey. They were grateful,
and were the most civil brigands I have ever
encountered.</p>

<p>While resting on the pass we had an amicable
conversation, and I asked them where they got
their beautiful clothes and the profusion of gold
and silver watch-chains.</p>

<p>"It is not everybody we meet, sahib, that has
a formidable revolver like yours," answered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-276" id="Pg_1-276"></a>[<a href="./images/1-276.png">276</a>]</span>
boisterous brigand, with a fit of sarcastic merriment,
echoed by all of us.</p>

<p>"Yes," I retorted in the same sarcastic spirit,
"if it had not been for the revolver, possibly
next time I came along this road I might meet
the company dressed up like sahibs, in my
clothes!"</p>

<p>I advised them to put up a white flag of truce
next time they sprang out from behind rocks
with the intention of holding up another Englishman,
or surely some day or other there
would be an accident.</p>

<p>We all laughed heartily, and parted with
repeated salaams&mdash;and my luggage intact.</p>

<p>In the moonlight I took the precaution to see
them well out of sight on one side of the pass
before we began to descend on the other, and
then we proceeded down the steep and rocky
incline.</p>

<p>We reached Soh (8,000 feet) early in the
morning, and went on to the Chappar house at
Biddeshk. Here one abandons the region of
the Kehriz Kohrud and Kale Karf mountains,
west and east of the road respectively, and travels
over a flat sandy country devoid of vegetation
and water.</p>

<p>Copper and iron are to be found at several
places in the mountains between Kashan and
Soh, for instance near Gudjar, at Dainum, and
at Kohrut.</p>

<p>October is the month when the Backhtiari
tribes are somewhat troublesome previous to
their return to winter quarters. A great many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-277" id="Pg_1-277"></a>[<a href="./images/1-277.png">277</a>]</span>
caravans are attacked and robbed on this road,
unless escorted by soldiers. Daring attempts
have even been made to seize caravans of silver
bullion for the Bank of Persia. Only a few
days before I went through, an English gentleman
travelling from Isfahan was robbed between
Soh and Murchikhar of all his baggage, money,
and clothes.</p>

<p>The country lends itself to brigandage. One
can see a flat plain for several miles to the north
and south, but to the west and east are most intricate
mountain masses where the robber bands
find suitable hiding places for themselves and their
booty. To the north-west we have flat open
country, but to the west from Biddeshk there
are as many as three different ranges of mountains.
To the east rises the peak Kehriz Natenz.
A great many low hill ranges lie between the
main backbone of the high and important range
extending from north-west to south-east, and the
route we follow, and it is curious to notice, not
only here but all over the parts of Persia I
visited, that the great majority of sand dunes,
and of hill and mountain ranges face north or
north-east. In other words, they extend either
from north-west to south-east, or roughly from
west to east; very seldom from north to south.</p>

<p>From Biddeshk two soldiers insisted on escorting
my luggage. I was advised to take
them, for in default, one cannot claim compensation
from the Persian Government should the
luggage be stolen. In the case of <i>bona fide</i>
European travellers, robbed on the road, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-278" id="Pg_1-278"></a>[<a href="./images/1-278.png">278</a>]</span>
Persian Government is extremely punctual in
making good the damage sustained and paying
ample compensation.</p>

<p>The method employed by the local Governor,
responsible for the safety of travellers on the
road, is to inflict heavy fines on all the natives of
the district in which the robbery has occurred,&mdash;a
very simple and apparently effective way, it
would seem, of stopping brigandage, but one
which, in fact, increases it, because, in order to
find the money to pay the fines, the natives are
driven to the road, each successive larceny going
towards part payment of the previous one.</p>

<p>One or two domed reservoirs of rain-water are
found by the road-side, but the water is very bad.</p>

<p>The soldiers, laden with cartridges, ran along
by the side of my horses and pretended to keep
a sharp look-out for robbers. Every now and
then they got much excited, loaded their rifles,
and fired away shot after shot at phantom
brigands, whom, they said, they perceived
peeping above sand hills a long way off.</p>

<p>At Murchikhar there is nothing to be seen.
The post-horses were very good here and I was
able to go through this uninteresting part of the
road at a good speed of from six to seven miles an
hour. To the west the mountains were getting
quite close, and, in fact, we had hills all round
except to the south-east. Murchikhar is at a
fairly high altitude, 5,600 ft.</p>

<p>One still heard much about brigands. Soldiers,
armed to the teeth, insisted on accompanying my
luggage. This, of course, involved endless back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-279" id="Pg_1-279"></a>[<a href="./images/1-279.png">279</a>]</span>shish,
but had to be put up with, as it is one of the
perquisites of the guards stationed at the various
stages. I have heard it stated that if one does
not require their services it is often these protectors
themselves who turn into robbers. There
is a guard-house on the road, and the two soldiers
stationed there told us that a large band of thirty
robbers had visited them during the early hours
of the morning, and had stolen from them all
their provisions, money and tobacco!</p>

<p>We were not troubled in any way, and, with
the exception of some suspicious horsemen a long
way off making for the mountains, we hardly
met a soul on the road.</p>

<p>A curious accident happened to one of my
luggage horses. For some reason of his own he
bolted, and galloped to the top of one of the
<i>kanat</i> cones, when getting frightened at the deep
hole before him he jumped it. His fore-legs
having given way on the steep incline on the
other side, he fell on his head and turned a
complete somersault, landing flat on his back,
where, owing to the packs, he remained with
his legs up in the air until we came to his aid
and freed him of the loads.</p>

<p>On nearing Ghiez the track is over undulating
country, but after that the road to Isfahan is
good and flat, but very sandy and dusty. I got to
Ghiez in the evening but proceeded at once to
Isfahan. We galloped on the twelve miles, and
in less than two hours I was most hospitably
received in the house of Mr. Preece, the British
Consul-General in Isfahan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is little to say of interest in connection
with Missionary work in Persia, except that a
considerable amount of good is being done in the
educational and medical line. There are well-established
schools and hospitals. The most
praiseworthy institution is the supply of medicinal
advice and medicine gratis or at a nominal cost.
As far as the work of Christianising is concerned,
it must be recollected that Missionaries are only
allowed in Persia on sufferance, and are on no
account permitted to make converts among the
Mahommedans. Any Mussulman, man, woman,
or child, who discards his religion for Christianity,
will in all probability lose his life.</p>

<p>If any Christianising work is done at all it
has to be done surreptitiously and at a considerable
amount of risk to both convert and converter.
Some interest in the Christian religion is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-282" id="Pg_1-282"></a>[<a href="./images/1-282.png">282</a>]</span>
nevertheless shown by Mussulmans of the younger
generation&mdash;who now are practically atheists
at heart&mdash;but whether this interest is genuine or
not it is not for me to say. There is much in
the Bible that impresses them, and I understand
that constant applications are made for copies of
translations into the Persian language. To avoid
the great waste which occurred when Bibles were
given away for nothing, a nominal charge is now
made so as to prevent people throwing the book
away or using it for evil purposes.</p>

<p>In Isfahan itself there are no missionaries
among the Mahommedans, but some are to be
found at Julfa, a suburb of Isfahan, on the south
bank of the Zindah-rud (river). Julfa was in
former days a prosperous Armenian settlement
of some 30,000 inhabitants, but is now mostly
in ruins since the great migration of Armenians
to India.</p>

<p>There is an Armenian Archbishop at Julfa.
He has no real power, but is much revered by
the Armenians themselves. He provides priests
for the Armenians of India.</p>

<p>A handsome cathedral, with elaborate ornamentations
and allegorical pictures, is one of the
principal structures in Julfa.</p>

<p>One cannot help admiring the Armenians of
Julfa for retaining their conservative customs
so long. Within the last few years, however,
rapid strides have been made towards the abandonment
of the ancient dress and tongue. At
Julfa the Armenians have to a great extent
retained their native language, which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-283" id="Pg_1-283"></a>[<a href="./images/1-283.png">283</a>]</span>
invariably speak among themselves, although
many of the men are equally fluent in Persian;
but in cities like Teheran, where they are thrown
into more direct contact with Persians, the Armenians
are almost more conversant with Persian
than with their own tongue. The men and
women of the better classes have adopted European
clothes, in which they might easily be
mistaken for Southern Italians or Spaniards.</p>

<p>But in Julfa such is not the case, and the
ancient style of dress is so far maintained. One
is struck by the great number of women in the
streets of Julfa and the comparative lack of men.
This is because all able-bodied men migrate to
India or Europe, leaving their women behind
until sufficient wealth is accumulated to export
them also to foreign lands.</p>

<p>The education of the Armenian women of
the middle and lower classes consists principally
in knitting socks&mdash;one sees rows of matrons and
girls sitting on the doorsteps busily employed
thus,&mdash;and in various forms of culinary instruction.
But the better class woman is well
educated in European fashion, and is bright and
intelligent.</p>

<p>The Armenian woman, in her ample and
speckless white robes, her semi-covered face, and
beautiful soft black eyes, is occasionally captivating.
The men, on the other hand, although
handsome, have something indescribable about
them that does not make them particularly
attractive.</p>

<p>The Armenian man&mdash;the true type of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-284" id="Pg_1-284"></a>[<a href="./images/1-284.png">284</a>]</span>
Levantine&mdash;has great business capacities, wonderful
facility for picking up languages, and a
persuasive flow of words ever at his command.
Sceptical, ironical and humorous&mdash;with a bright,
amusing manner alike in times of plenty or
distress&mdash;a born philosopher, but uninspiring
of confidence,&mdash;with eyes that never look straight
into yours, but are ever roaming all over the
place,&mdash;with religious notions adaptable to
business prospects,&mdash;very hospitable and good-hearted,
given to occasional orgies,&mdash;such is the
Persian-Armenian of to-day.</p>

<p>The more intelligent members of the male
community migrate to better pastures, where
they succeed, by steady hard work and really
practical brains, in amassing considerable fortunes.
The less enterprising remain at home to make
and sell wine. Personally, I found Armenians
surprisingly honest.</p>

<p>In Julfa the Europeans&mdash;of whom, except in
business, there are few&mdash;have comfortable, almost
luxurious residences. The principal streets of the
Settlement are extremely clean and nice for
Persia. The Indo-European Telegraph Office is
also here. But the best part of Julfa&mdash;from a
pictorial point of view&mdash;is the extensive Armenian
cemetery, near a picturesque background
of hills and directly on the slopes of Mount
Sofia. There are hundreds of rectangular tombstones,
many with neatly bevelled edges, and
epitaphs of four or five lines. A cross is engraved
on each grave, and some have a little urn at the
head for flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-285" id="Pg_1-285"></a>[<a href="./images/1-285.png">285</a>]</span></p>

<p>From the roof of a house situated at the
highest point of the inclined plane, one obtains
a magnificent bird's-eye view of Isfahan, its
ancient grandeur being evinced by the great
expanse of ruins all round it. The walls of
Isfahan were said at one time to measure twenty-four
miles in circumference. Like all other cities
of Persia, Isfahan does not improve by too distant
a view. The mud roofs are so alike in colour to
the dried mud of the streets that a deadly
monotony must follow, as a matter of course;
but the many beautiful green gardens round
about and in Isfahan itself are a great relief to
the eye, and add much attraction to the landscape.</p>

<p>Most prominent of all buildings in the city
are the great semi-spherical dome of the Mesjid-i-Shah,
with its gracefully ornamented tiles; the
Madrassah; the multi-columned, flat-roofed
Palace, and the high minarets in couples, dotted
all over the city. Then round about, further
away, stand any number of curious circular
towers, the pigeon towers.</p>

<p>The bed of the river between Isfahan and
Julfa is over six hundred feet wide, and is
spanned by three bridges. One of these, with
thirty-four arches, is no less than 1,000 ft. in
length, but is much out of repair.</p>

<p>The Armenian Christians of Julfa are enjoying
comparative safety at present, but until quite
recently were much persecuted by the Mahommedans,
the Mullahs being particularly bitter
against them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-286" id="Pg_1-286"></a>[<a href="./images/1-286.png">286</a>]</span></p>

<p>One sees a great many priests about Julfa, and
as I visited the place on a Sunday the people
looked so very demure and sanctimonious&mdash;I am
speaking of the Armenians&mdash;on their way out of
church; taciturn and with head low or talking
in a whisper, all toddling alongside the wall&mdash;as
people from church generally do,&mdash;that I must
confess I was glad when I left this place of
oppressive sanctity and returned to Isfahan.
Somehow, Julfa impresses one as a discordant
note in Persian harmony&mdash;although a very fine
and pleasing note in itself.</p>

<p>Until quite recently the Persians objected to
foreigners residing even in Isfahan itself. The
officials of the Bank of Persia were the first to
take up their abode within the city wall, then
soon after came Mr. Preece, our able and
distinguished Consul-General.</p>

<p>There is now a third Englishman residing in
Jubareh, the Jewish quarter, the Revd. James
Loraine Garland, of the London Society for
Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews of
Isfahan. Why such a Society should exist at all
seems to any one with a sense of humour bewildering,
but on getting over the first shock of
surprise one finds that of all the Missions to Persia
it is probably the most sensible, and worked
on practical, sound, useful lines. Much as I am
unfavourably inclined towards religious Missions
of any kind, I could not help being impressed
with Mr. Garland's very interesting work.</p>

<p>The first time I saw Mr. Garland I was nearly
run over by him as he was riding a race with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-287" id="Pg_1-287"></a>[<a href="./images/1-287.png">287</a>]</span>
sporting friend on the Golahek road near Teheran&mdash;raising
clouds of dust, much to the concern of
passers-by.</p>

<p>The same day I met Mr. Garland in Teheran,
when he was garbed in the ample clothes of the
sporting friend, his own wardrobe having been
stolen, with his money and all other possessions,
by robbers on the Isfahan-Kashan road. In
fact, he was the Englishman referred to in
Chapter XXVI.</p>

<p>Being somewhat of a sportsman myself, this
highly-sporting clergyman appealed to me. Extremely
gentlemanly, courteous, tactful, sensible
and open-minded, he was not a bit like a
missionary. He was a really good man. His
heart and soul were in his work. He very
kindly asked me to visit his Mission in Isfahan,
and it was a real pleasure to see a Mission worked
on such sensible lines.</p>

<p>The first Mission to the Jews of Persia and
Chaldea was established in 1844 by the Reverend
Dr. Stern, who resided part of the year in
Bagdad, and the remainder in Isfahan. The
work was up-hill, and in 1865 the Mission was
suspended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> October, 1889, to December, 1891, a
Christianised Jew of Teheran, named Mirza
Korollah, worked in Isfahan as the representative
of the Society for promoting Christianity among
the Jews. A Bible dep&ocirc;t was opened, and a
school started at the request of the Jews themselves.
In December, 1891, however, Mirza
Korollah was banished from the city, and the
work was again interrupted.</p>

<p>In 1897, Mr. Garland volunteered to undertake
the work in Persia, and his offer was gladly
accepted. On his arrival in Isfahan he found,
he told me, a prosperous boys' school, that had
been re-opened in 1894 by a native Jewish
Christian, who rejoiced in the name of Joseph
Hakim, and who carried on the educational work
under the supervision of members of the Church
Missionary Society resident in Julfa. It was
deemed advisable to commence a night-school,
as many of the boys were unable to attend day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-289" id="Pg_1-289"></a>[<a href="./images/1-289.png">289</a>]</span>
classes. The scheme answered very well, and
has been steadily continued.</p>

<p>As many as 200 boys attended the school daily
in February, 1898, a fact that shows the success
of the new enterprise from the very beginning.</p>

<p>At the invitation of a number of Jewesses, Miss
Stuart, the Bishop of Waiapu's daughter, kindly
consented to go over twice a week to the Jewish
quarter to instruct them in the Holy Scriptures.
This led to the commencement of a girls'
school with twelve pupils, at a time of great
turmoil and anxiety. However, the experiment
had the happiest results.</p>

<p>It was not, nevertheless, till 1899 that Mr.
Garland was able to take up his abode in the
Jewish quarter. He met with no opposition
whatever from Mahommedans or Jews. The
usual Sunday service, attended by converts and
inquirers, and a Saturday afternoon class were
commenced in 1899, and have uninterruptedly
continued to the present time.</p>

<p>To me, personally, the most important part of
the Mission, and one to which more time is
devoted than to praying, was the excellent carpentry
class for boys, begun in 1900, and the
carpet-weaving apparatus set up on the premises
for the girls. The former has been a great
success, even financially, and is paying its way.
The latter, although financially not yet a success,
is of great value in teaching the girls how to
weave. Necessarily, so many hands have to be
employed in the manufacture of a large carpet,
and the time spent in the manufacture is so long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-290" id="Pg_1-290"></a>[<a href="./images/1-290.png">290</a>]</span>
that it is hardly possible to expect financial prosperity
from mere beginners; but the class teaches
the girls a way to earn money for themselves in
future years.</p>

<p>Both trades were selected by Mr. Garland, particularly
because they were the most suitable in a
country where Jews are excluded from the more
honest and manly trades, and Jewesses often
grow up to be more of a hindrance than a help
to their husbands. Worse still is the case of
Jews who become Christians; they have the
greatest difficulty in earning their living at all.</p>

<p>These industrial occupations are a great practical
help to the studies of the pupils, who are taught,
besides their own language, Persian and Hebrew,
and, if they wish, English, geography, etc.</p>

<p>More frivolous but less remunerative forms of
recreation, such as cricket, tennis, football, or
gymnastic drills,&mdash;which invariably accompany
Christianity in the East, and develop most parts
of a convert's anatomy except his brain,&mdash;have
not been deemed of sufficient importance among
the Jews of Isfahan, who would, moreover, think
our best English games or muscle-developers in
the highest degree indecorous and unseemly.</p>

<p>On the whole the Society's work among the
Jews of Teheran, Hamadan and Isfahan has been
most encouraging, and this is to be put down
entirely to the tact and personal influence of Mr.
Garland, who is greatly respected by Jews and
Mahommedans alike. No better testimony to
the appreciation of his work could exist than the
fact that in his interesting journeys through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-291" id="Pg_1-291"></a>[<a href="./images/1-291.png">291</a>]</span>
Persia, he is frequently invited to preach in
crowded synagogues.</p>

<p>It seems probable that the Jews of Persia are
descendants of the Ten Tribes, and more probable
still that Jews have resided in Isfahan from
its earliest foundation.</p>

<p>In the tenth century&mdash;under the Dilemi
dynasty&mdash;Isfahan consisted of two cities, Yahoodieh
(Jewry) and Shehristan (the City). In
the middle of the twelfth century, according to
Benjamin of Tudela, the Jews of Isfahan numbered
15,000.</p>

<p>At present they number about 5,000. They
are mostly pedlars by profession, or engaged in
making silk thread (Abreesham K&acirc;r, Charkht&acirc;bee,
etc.). There are a few merchants of comparative
influence. Jewellers and traders in precious
stones, brokers and wine-sellers are frequent, but
the majority consists almost entirely of diviners,
musicians, dancers&mdash;music and dancing are considered
low, contemptible occupations in Persia&mdash;scavengers,
and beggars.</p>

<p>The Jews of Isfahan, like those of all other
cities in Persia, have been subjected to a great
deal of oppression. There is a story that
Timour-i-Lang (Tamerlane&mdash;end of 14th century)
was riding past a synagogue in Isfahan,
where the Mesjid-i-Ali now stands, and that the
Jews made such a horrible noise at their prayers
(in saying the "Shema, Israel" on the Day of
Atonement) that his horse bolted and he was
thrown and lamed. Hence his name, and
hence also a terrible massacre of the Jews,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-292" id="Pg_1-292"></a>[<a href="./images/1-292.png">292</a>]</span>
which reduced their number to about one-third.</p>

<p>Even to this day it is not easy for Jews to
obtain justice against Mahommedans. Only as
recently as 1901 a Jew was murdered in cold
blood a few miles from Isfahan, and his body
flung into the river. Although the murder had
been witnessed, and the murderer was well
known, no punishment was ever inflicted upon
him.</p>

<p class="illc">An Isfahan Jew.</p>

<p>The Jews of Isfahan possess striking features,
as can be seen by a characteristic head of a man
reproduced in the illustration. The face is
generally very much elongated, with aquiline
nose of abnormal length and very broad at the
nostrils. The brow is heavy, screening deeply-sunken
eyes revealing a mixed expression of sadness
and slyness, tempered somewhat by probable
abuse of animal qualities. Of a quiet and rather
sulky nature&mdash;corroded by ever-unsatisfied avidity&mdash;assumedly
courteous, but morose by nature,&mdash;with
a mighty level head in the matter of
business; such is the Jew of Isfahan. He is
extremely picturesque, quite biblical in his long
loose robe and skull cap, with turban wound
tight round his head.</p>

<p>Jewish girls when very young are nice-looking
without being beautiful, very supple and pensive,
and with expressive eyes. They lack the unsteady,
insincere countenance of the men, and
have reposeful, placid faces, with occasional
good features. There is a good deal of character
in their firmly closed lips, the upper lip being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-293" id="Pg_1-293"></a>[<a href="./images/1-293.png">293</a>]</span>
slightly heavy but well-shaped. The inside of
the mouth is adorned with most regular, firm,
and beautiful teeth. Curiously enough, the
typical Jewish nose&mdash;so characteristic in men&mdash;is
seldom markedly noticeable in women. I
have even seen Jewish girls with turned-up
noses. Their arms are beautifully modelled,
and the hands as a whole extremely graceful,
with unusually long and supple fingers, but
with badly-shaped nails of an unwholesome
colour.</p>

<p>Jewesses in Persia are not kept in seclusion
and go about with uncovered faces, which
exposes them to constant and unpleasant insult
from the Mahommedans. They dress differently
from Persian women, with a long skirt of either
black, blue, or coloured cotton. The head is
framed in a white kerchief, leaving exposed the
jet black hair parted in the middle and covering
the temples. Over that is worn a long cloak,
either black or white, almost identical with the
Persian "chudder."</p>

<p>Jewesses are said to be most affectionate and
devoted to their husbands and their families.
They are extremely amenable to reason&mdash;except
in cases of jealousy, which is one of the leading
characteristics of the race in general and of Jewish
women in particular. They are hard-working,
intelligent, thrifty. They take life seriously:
are endowed with no sense of humour to speak
of&mdash;it would be difficult to have any under their
circumstances&mdash;and whether owing to severe
an&aelig;mia, caused by wretched and insufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-294" id="Pg_1-294"></a>[<a href="./images/1-294.png">294</a>]</span>
food, or to some external influence, are often
affected by melancholia.</p>

<p>Soft and shy in manner and speech, under
normal circumstances, pale and silent, the Jewish
woman is not unattractive.</p>

<p>One of the few occupations open to Jewesses
is the practice of midwifery.</p>

<p>Hunted as the Jews are by everybody in the
streets, and in the bazaar, insulted, spat upon,
the women often compelled to prostitution, it is
to be marvelled that any honesty at all is left in
them.</p>

<p>The higher Persian schools and colleges do not
admit Jews as students, nor is education permitted
to them even in the lower Persian schools.
Therefore, the welcome work of Mr. Garland is
much needed and appreciated. A special quarter
is reserved in which the Jews must live, huddled
together, the majority of them in abject poverty.
Until of late no peace was given them. Their
customs were interfered with in every way by
vagabond Persians, and the little money they
made by industrious habits was extorted from
them by officials or by the enterprising Persian
to whom the Jewish community was farmed
out.</p>

<p>The Jews of a city are taxed a certain sum,
usually beyond what they can afford to pay.
Some speculator undertakes to pay the amount
for them to the local Governor and receives
authority to compensate himself from the Jewish
community as best he can, either by making
them work, or trade, or by selling their clothes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-295" id="Pg_1-295"></a>[<a href="./images/1-295.png">295</a>]</span>
or depriving them of the few articles of furniture
they may possess.</p>

<p>Until quite lately, at public festivities the meek
and resigned Jews were driven before an insulting
mob who held them in derision, and exposed
them to most abject treatment; some of their
number ending by being pitched into the water-tank
which adorns the courtyard or garden of
most residences. Little by little, however, with
the spread of civilisation, Jews have been spared
the torture of these baths.</p>

<p>The Jew is looked upon as unclean and untrustworthy
by the Persian, who refuses to use
him as a soldier, but who gladly employs him to
do all sorts of dirty jobs which Persian pride
would not allow him to do himself. His social
level therefore stands even lower than that of the
Shotri of India, the outcast who does not stop at
the basest occupations.</p>

<p>The majority of the older Jews are illiterate,
but not unintelligent. Each city has one or
more Rabbis or priests, but they have no power
and receive a good share of the insults in the
Persian bazaars.</p>

<p>Whatever feeling of repulsion towards the
race one may have, the position of the Jews in
Persia&mdash;although infinitely better than it was
before&mdash;is still a most pathetic one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great square of Isfahan is looked upon as
the centre of the city. It is a huge oblong, with
the great and beautiful dome of the Mesjid-i-Shah
on one side of the long rectangle, and another
high domed mosque with two high minarets at
the end. The very impressive red and white
quadrangular palace gate, flat-topped, and with a
covered blue verandah supported on numerous
slender columns, stands on the side of the square
opposite the Mesjid-i-Shah mosque.</p>

<p>To the north of the great square one enters
the bazaar by a high gate, handsomely tiled with
flower ornamentations; this gateway has three
lower windows and a triple upper one, and a
doorway under the cool shade of the outer projecting
pointed archway. To the right of the
entrance as one looks at it, rises a three-storied
building as high as the gate of the bazaar. It
has a pretty upper verandah, the roof of which
is supported on transverse sets of three wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-297" id="Pg_1-297"></a>[<a href="./images/1-297.png">297</a>]</span>
columns each, except the outer corner roof-supports,
which are square and of bricks. In
front is an artistic but most untidy conglomeration
of awnings to protect from the sun pedlars,
merchants and people enjoying their kalians,
or a thimbleful of tea.</p>

<p>There are men selling fruit which is displayed
upon the dirty ground, and there are tired horses
with dismounted cavaliers sleeping by their side,
the reins fastened for precaution to a heavy stone
or slung to the arm. One sees masses of children
of all ages and conditions of health, from the neatly
attired son of the wealthy merchant, who disports
himself with his eldest brother, to the orphan
boy, starving, and in rags covered with mud.
There is a little cripple with a shrunken leg, and
further, an old man with lupus in its most ghastly
form. Disreputably-clothed soldiers lie about in
the crowd, and a woman or two with their faces
duly screened in white cloths may be seen.</p>

<p>The sight of a sahib always excites great
curiosity in Persia. Followed by a crowd of
loafers and most insistent beggars, one forces
one's way into the crowded bazaar, while the
ghulams of the Consulate&mdash;without whom it
would be indecorous to go anywhere&mdash;shove the
people on one side or the other without ceremony,
drive the donkeys, laden with wood or panniers
of fruit, into the shops&mdash;much to the horror of
the shopman,&mdash;and disband the strings of mules
and the horsemen to make room for the passing
sahib.</p>

<p>It is very difficult, under such circumstances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-298" id="Pg_1-298"></a>[<a href="./images/1-298.png">298</a>]</span>
to stop any length of time at any particular spot
to study the shops, the shop-people, and the
buyers, for instead of being an unobserved
spectator, one is at all times the principal actor
in the scene and the centre of attention, and
therefore a most disturbing element in the
crowd.</p>

<p>There are so many complicated and tiresome
formalities to be adhered to in order to avoid
offending the natives, or the officials, or the
susceptibilities of foreign residents, who seem to
feel responsible for the doings of every traveller&mdash;and
who, at all events, remain to suffer for
the untactful deeds of some of them,&mdash;and there
are so many things one must not do for fear of
destroying the prestige of one's country, that,
really, if one possesses a simple and practical
mind, one gets rather tired of Persian town life,
with its exaggerated ties, its empty outward show
and pomp and absolute lack of more modest aims
which, after all, make real happiness in life.</p>

<p class="illc">The Square, Isfahan.</p>

<p>As for European ladies it is considered most
improper to be seen with uncovered faces in the
bazaar. In fact, walking anywhere in the town
they are generally exposed to insult.</p>

<p>I once took a walk through the various bazaars,
but the second time, at our Consul's recommendation,
was advised to ride in state, with gold-braided,
mounted Consulate ghulams preceding
and following me, while I myself rode a magnificent
stallion presented by Zil-es-Sultan to our
Consul. The horse had not been ridden for
some time and was slightly fresh. The place to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-299" id="Pg_1-299"></a>[<a href="./images/1-299.png">299</a>]</span>
which we directed our animals was the brass
bazaar, the most crowded and diabolically noisy
place in the Shah's dominions.</p>

<p>The sudden change from the brilliant light of
the sun to the pitch darkness of the vaulted
bazaar, affected one's sight, and it was some
few seconds before one could distinguish anything,
although one could hear the buzzing
noise of an excited crowd, and the cries of the
ghulams ordering the people to make room for
the cavalcade.</p>

<p>In nearly all bazaars of the principal cities of
Persia a very good custom prevails. One or
more streets are devoted entirely to the same
article, so that the buyer may conveniently make
comparisons, and the various merchants are also
kept up to the mark by the salutary competition
close at hand thus rendered unavoidable. A
Persian does not go to a shop to buy anything
without going to every other shop in the bazaar
to ask whether he can get a similar article better
and cheaper. Such a convenience as fixed
prices, alike for all, does not exist in the Persian
bazaar, and prices are generally on the ascending
or descending scale, according to the merchant's
estimate of his customer's wealth. It is looked
upon as a right and a duty to extort from a rich
man the maximum of profit, whereas from a poor
fellow a few shais benefit are deemed sufficient.</p>

<p>To buy anything at all in the bazaar involves
great loss of time&mdash;and patience,&mdash;excessive
consumption of tea plus the essential kalian-smoking.
Two or three or more visits are paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-300" id="Pg_1-300"></a>[<a href="./images/1-300.png">300</a>]</span>
to the stall by Persian buyers before they can
come to an agreement with the merchant, and
when the goods are delivered it is the merchant's
turn to pay endless visits to his customer's
house before he can obtain payment for them.
Long credit is generally given by merchants to
people known to them. There is comparatively
little ready money business done except in the
cheapest goods.</p>

<p>We shoved our way along through the very
narrow streets with a long row before us of sun
columns, piercing through the circular openings
in the domed arcade of the bazaar, and projecting
brilliant patches of light now on brightly-coloured
turbans, now on the black chudder of
a woman, now on the muddy ground constantly
sprinkled with water to keep the streets cool.</p>

<p>There are miles of bazaar, in Teheran and
Isfahan, roofed over in long arcades to protect
the shops and buyers from the sun in summer,
from the rain and snow in winter. The height
of the arcade is from thirty to sixty feet, the
more ancient ones being lower than the modern
ones.</p>

<p>To any one well acquainted with other Eastern
countries there is absolutely nothing in a Persian
bazaar that is worth buying. The old and
beautiful objects of art have left the country long
ago, and the modern ones have neither sufficient
artistic merit nor intrinsic value to be worth the
trouble and expense of sending them home. For
curiosity's sake&mdash;yes, there are a few tawdry
articles which may amuse friends in Europe, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-301" id="Pg_1-301"></a>[<a href="./images/1-301.png">301</a>]</span>
what I mean is that there is nothing that is really
of intense interest or skilful workmanship, such
as one can find in Japan, in China, in Morocco
or Egypt.</p>

<p>We ride through the street of hatters, each
shop with walls lined with piles of <i>kolah</i> hats,
black and brimless, shaped either in the section
of a cone or rounded with a depression on the
top. They are made of astrakan or of black felt,
and are worn by the better people; but further
on we come to cheaper shops, where spherical
skull caps of white or light brown felt are being
manufactured for the lower classes.</p>

<p>As we ride along, a stinging smell of dyes tells
us that we are in the cloth street, indigo colours
prevailing, and also white and black cottons
and silks. One cannot help pitying the sweating
shopman, who is busy unrolling cloths of various
makes before a number of squatting women, who
finger each and confabulate among themselves,
and request to have the roll deposited by their
side for further consideration with a mountain of
other previously unrolled fabrics,&mdash;just like
women at home. The rolls are taken from neat
wooden shelves, on which, however, they seldom
rest. Soiled remnants of European stocks play
a very important part in this section of the
bazaar.</p>

<p>On turning round a corner we have shoes and
boots, foreign made, of the favourite side-elastic
pattern, or the native white canvas ones with
rope soles&mdash;most comfortable and serviceable for
walking. The local leather ones have strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-302" id="Pg_1-302"></a>[<a href="./images/1-302.png">302</a>]</span>
soles with nails and turned-up toes, not unlike
the familiar Turkish shoe; while the slippers
for women have no back to them at the heel
and have fancy toes.</p>

<p>Then come the attractive sweet-shops, with
huge trays of transparent candy, and the <i>Pash
mak</i> pulled sugar, as white and light as raw silk,
most delicious but sticky. In bottles above, the
eye roams from highly coloured confetti to
<i>Abnabad</i> and <i>Kors</i> or other deadly-looking
lozenges, while a crowd of enraptured children
deposit shais in the hands of the prosperous
trader, who promptly weighs and gives in exchange
a full measure of <i>rahat-ul-holkoom</i>, "the
ease of the throat," or candied sugar, duly
packed in paper bags.</p>

<p>There is nothing very attractive in the
butchers' bazaar; the long rows of skinned
animals black with flies, and in various degrees
of freshness, made even less artistic by ornamentations
of paper rosettes and bits of gold and
silver paper. Beef, camel, mutton, game and
chickens, all dead and with throats cut&mdash;the
Mahommedan fashion of killing&mdash;can be purchased
here, but the smell of meat is so strong
and sickening that we will promptly adjourn to
the leather-work bazaar.</p>

<p>For a man, this is probably the most typical
and interesting section of the Persian retail
commerce. There is something picturesque
and artistic in the clumsy silver or brass or iron
mounted saddles, with handsome red, or green,
or brown ample leather flaps, gracefully orna<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-303" id="Pg_1-303"></a>[<a href="./images/1-303.png">303</a>]</span>mented
with more or less elaboration to suit the
pockets of different customers. Then the harness
is pretty, with its silver inlaid iron decoration,
or solid silver or brass, and the characteristic
stirrups, nicely chiselled and not unlike the
Mexican ones. The greater part of the foot
can rest on the stirrup, so broad is its base.
Then come the saddlebags of all sizes, the
<i>horjin</i>, in cloth, in sacking, in expensive leather,
in carpeting, of all prices, with an ingenious
device of a succession of loops fastening the
one into the other, the last with a padlock, to
secure the contents of the bag from intrusive
hands.</p>

<p>These <i>horjins</i>&mdash;or double bags&mdash;are extremely
convenient and are the most usual contrivance
in Persia for conveying luggage on horseback or
mules.</p>

<p>Then in the lower part of the shop there is a
grand display of leather purses, sheaths for
knives, and a collection of leather stock whips,
gracefully tied into multiple knots.</p>

<p>In this same bazaar, where everything in
connection with riding or loading animals can
be purchased, are also to be found the bell shops.
These confine themselves particularly to horses',
mules' and camels' neck decorations. Long
tassels, either red or black, in silk or dyed horsehair,
silk or leather bands with innumerable
small conical shrill bells, and sets of larger bells
in successive gradations of sizes, one hanging
inside the other, are found here. Then there
are some huge cylindrical bells standing about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-304" id="Pg_1-304"></a>[<a href="./images/1-304.png">304</a>]</span>
two and a half feet high, with scrolls and geometrical
designs on their sides. These are for
camels and are not intended to hang from the
neck. They are slung on one side under the
lighter of the two loads of the pack.</p>

<p class="illc">The Palace Gate, Isfahan.</p>

<p>Next, one is attracted by a shop full of leather
trunks, of the reddest but not the best morocco,
stretched while wet upon a rough wooden
frame. Primitive ornamentations are painted
on the leather, and the corners of each box are
strengthened with tin caps and rings. The
trunks for pack animals are better made than the
others, and are solidly sewn, with heavy straps
and rings to sling them upon the saddles.
Gaudy revolver pouches, cartridge belts, and
slings for daggers are to be purchased in the
same shop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Winding</span> our way through the labyrinth of
narrow streets, and meeting a crescendo of
diabolical din as we approach it, we emerge into
a more spacious and lighter arcade, where
hundreds of men are hammering with all their
might upon pieces of copper that are being
shaped into trays, pots with double spouts, or
pans. This is the coppersmiths' bazaar. On a
long low brick platform, extending from one end
to the other on both sides of the street, is tastefully
arranged the work already finished. Huge
circular trays have coarse but elaborate ornamentations
of figures, trees and birds chiselled
upon them&mdash;not unlike the Indian Benares trays
in general appearance, but not in the character of
the design. Copper vases with spouts are gracefully
shaped, the ancient Persian models being
maintained. They are much used by Persians in
daily life. More elaborate is the long-necked
vessel with a circular body and slender curved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-306" id="Pg_1-306"></a>[<a href="./images/1-306.png">306</a>]</span>
spout, that rests upon a very quaint and elegantly
designed wash-basin with perforated cover and
exaggerated rim. This is used after meals in the
household of the rich, when an attendant pours
tepid water scented with rose-water upon the
fingers, which have been used in eating instead
of a fork. These vessels and basins are usually
of brass. All along the ground, against the wall,
stand sets of concentric trays of brass, copper and
pewter, and metal tumblers innumerable, having
execrable designs upon them, and rendered more
hideous by being nickel-plated all over. Each
shop, about ten to twenty feet long and eight to
fifteen wide, has a furnace in one corner.</p>

<p>Considering the few and primitive tools
employed, it is really wonderful that the work is
as good as it is. The polishing of trays is
generally done with their feet by boys, who
stand on them and with a circular motion of the
body revolve the tray to the right and left upon
a layer of wet sand until, after some hours of
labour, a sufficiently shiny surface is obtained by
friction.</p>

<p>I became much interested in watching a man
joining together two pieces of metal to be turned
into an amphora, but the noise made the horse I
rode very restless. It was impossible to hear
any one speak, the din of the hammered metal
being so acute and being echoed in each dome of
the arcade. The horse became so alarmed when
the bellows began to blow upon the fire that he
tried to throw me, first by standing on his fore-legs
and scattering the crowd of yelling natives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-307" id="Pg_1-307"></a>[<a href="./images/1-307.png">307</a>]</span>
with his hindlegs, then by standing up erect the
other way about. In a moment the place was
clear of people; some had leapt on to the side
platform: others had rushed inside the shops.
The horse delighted in pirouetting about, kicking
the nearest metal vases and trays all over the
place, and causing quite a commotion. It was
rather amusing to watch the rapidity with which
the merchants a little way off withdrew their
goods to safety inside the premises to prevent
further damage. The horse, being then satisfied
that he could not shake me off, continued the
journey more or less peacefully through the
bazaar.</p>

<p>Here is a mirror shop&mdash;imports from Austria.
There the flourishing grain merchants, whose
premises are the neatest and cleanest of the whole
bazaar. Each merchant tastily displays his various
cereals in heaps on speckless enormous brass trays,
and by the side of them dried fruit, in which he
also deals extensively. His shop is decorated
with silvered or red or blue glass balls.</p>

<p>Further on is another very neat place, the
curdled-milk retailer's, with large flat metal tanks
filled with milk, and a great many trays, large
and little, in front of his premises. He, too,
keeps his place and belongings&mdash;but not himself&mdash;most
beautifully clean. He does a flourishing
business.</p>

<p>Every now and then we come upon a very
spacious and well-lighted room, with gaudy
candelabras of Bohemian glass, and a large
steaming samovar. This is a tea-shop. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-308" id="Pg_1-308"></a>[<a href="./images/1-308.png">308</a>]</span>
are plenty of men in it, in green or brown or
blue long coats, and all squatting lazily, cross-legged,
sipping tea from tiny glasses and being
helped to sugar from a large tray containing a
mountain of it.</p>

<p>The fruit and vegetable bazaar is always a
feature of Persian city markets, water-melons,
cucumbers, grapes, apples, pomegranates, almonds
and walnuts playing a prominent part
in the various displays. Then there is the
retailer of peeled walnuts, a man who wears a
red cap and green coat, and who sells his goods
spread on a brass tray. The walnuts as soon as
peeled from their skin are thrown into a large
basin full of water, and when properly washed
are spread on the tray to dry, ready for consumption.</p>

<p>The walnut man is generally a character.
He keeps his stall open even at night, when
other shops are closed, and has plenty to say to
all the passers-by on the merits of his walnuts.</p>

<p>To enumerate all one sees in the bazaar would
take a volume to itself, but on glancing through
we see the excited auctioneer in his white turban
calling out figures on an ascending scale,
and tapping on a piece of wood when a sufficient
sum is offered and no more bids are forthcoming.
He has assistants showing round the various
articles as they are being sold,&mdash;umbrellas,
tooth-brushes, mirrors, knives, etc.</p>

<p>The pipe shops are small&mdash;with black and
red and blue earthenware cups for the kalian.
There is not much variety in the shape of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-309" id="Pg_1-309"></a>[<a href="./images/1-309.png">309</a>]</span>
pipes except that some are made to be used in
the joined hands as a draw-pipe for the smoke,
the cup being held between the thumbs.
Others, the majority of them, are intended for
the top part of the kalian.</p>

<p>The barber's shop is a quaint one, remarkably
clean with whitewashed walls and a brick floor.
Up to some five feet along the walls is nailed a
cloth, usually red, against which the customers
rest their heads while being shaved. Hung
upon the walls are scissors of all sizes, razors,
and various other implements such as forceps for
drawing teeth, sharp lancets for bleeding, the
knives used for the operation of circumcision, and
a variety of wooden combs and branding irons.</p>

<p>Yes, the Persian barber has multifarious occupations.
He is surgeon, dentist and masseur,
besides being an adept with comb and razor.
He is&mdash;like his brother of the West&mdash;an
incessant talker, and knows all the scandal of
the town. While at work he has a bowl of
clean water by his side which he uses on the
patient's face or top of the skull and neck,
which are in male Persians all clean-shaved.
No soap is used by typical Persian barbers.
Their short razors, in wooden cases, are stropped
on the barber's arm, or occasionally leg, and are
quite sharp.</p>

<p>The younger folks of Persia shave the top of
the skull leaving long locks of hair at the side
of the head, which are gracefully pushed over
the ear and left hanging long behind, where
they are cut in a straight horizontal line round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-310" id="Pg_1-310"></a>[<a href="./images/1-310.png">310</a>]</span>
the neck. This fashion is necessitated by the
custom in Persia of never removing the heavy
headgear. The elder people, in fact, shave every
inch of the scalp, but balance this destruction of
hair by growing a long beard, frequently dyed
bright red or jet black with henna and indigo.</p>

<p>The bread-shops of Persia are quaint, a piece
of bread being sometimes as big as a small
blanket and about as thick. These huge flat
loaves are hung up on slanting shelves. In
Central and Southern Persia, however, the
smaller kind of bread is more commonly used,
not unlike an Indian <i>chapati</i>. A ball of flour
paste is well fingered and pawed until it gets to
a semi-solid consistency. It is then flung several
times from one palm of the hand into the other,
after which it is spread flat with a roller upon a
level stone slab. A few indentations are made
upon its face with the end of the baker's fingers;
it is taken up and thrown with a rapid movement
upon the inner domed portion of a small
oven, some three to four feet high, within which
blazes a big charcoal fire. Several loaves are
thus baked against the hot walls and roof of the
oven, which has an aperture at the top, and
when properly roasted and beginning to curl and
fall they are seized with wonderful quickness
and brought out of the oven. Gloves on the
hands and a cover over the baker's face are
necessary to prevent burns and asphyxia from the
escaping gases of the charcoal from the aperture
over which the man must lean every time.</p>

<p>In the bazaars of large cities one finds every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-311" id="Pg_1-311"></a>[<a href="./images/1-311.png">311</a>]</span>
now and then large caravanserais, handsome
courts with a tank of water in the centre and
shops all round. It is here that wholesale
dealers and traders have their premises, and that
caravans are accommodated on their arrival with
goods. There are generally trees planted all
round these courts to shade the animals and
buyers, and often a high and broad platform or
verandah all round, where the goods are spread
for inspection. Some of the richer caravanserais
are quite handsome, with neat latticed windows
and doors. The walls are painted white. The
court is crammed with tired camels, mules,
beggars and loafers.</p>

<p>The camel men squat in one corner to smoke
their pipes and eat their bread, while the
merchants form another ring up above on the
verandah, where prices are discussed at the top
of their voices, a crowd of ever-to-be-found
loafers taking active part in the discussion.</p>

<p>On a Friday, the day of rest of the
Mahommedan, the bazaar, so crowded on other
days, is absolutely deserted. All the shops&mdash;if a
hatter or two be excepted&mdash;are barricaded with
heavy wooden shutters and massive padlocks of
local or Russian make. Barring a dog or two
either lying asleep along the wall, or scraping a
heap of refuse in the hope of satisfying hunger&mdash;there
is hardly a soul walking about. Attracted
by a crowd in the distance, one finds a fanatic
gesticulating like mad and shouting at the top of
his voice before an admiring crowd of ragamuffins
squatting round him in a circle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-312" id="Pg_1-312"></a>[<a href="./images/1-312.png">312</a>]</span></p>

<p>On these holidays, when the streets are clear,
the effect of the columns of sunlight pouring down
from the small circular apertures from each dome
of the arcade, and some twenty feet apart, is very
quaint. It is like a long colonnade of brilliant
light in the centre of the otherwise dark, muddy-looking,
long, dirty tunnel. At noon, when the
sun is on the meridian, these sun columns are,
of course, almost perfectly vertical, but not so
earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A visit</span> to a carpet factory proves interesting.
The horses must be left, for it is necessary to
squeeze through a low and narrow door in order
to enter the shed where the carpets are made.</p>

<p>Every one is familiar with the intricate and
gorgeous designs of Persian carpets, and one
imagines that only veteran skilful artisans can
tackle such artistic work. One cannot, therefore,
help almost collapsing with surprise on
seeing mere children from the age of six to ten
working away at the looms with a quickness and
ease that makes one feel very small.</p>

<p>In badly lighted and worse ventilated rooms,
they sit perched in long rows on benches at
various altitudes from the floor, according to the
progression and size of the carpet, the web of
which is spread tight vertically in front of them.
Occasionally when the most difficult patterns are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-314" id="Pg_1-314"></a>[<a href="./images/1-314.png">314</a>]</span>
executed, or for patterns with European innovations
in the design, a coloured drawing is
hung up above the workers; but usually there is
nothing for them to go by, except that a superintendent&mdash;an
older boy&mdash;sings out the stitches
in a monotonous cadence. A row of coloured
balls of the various coloured threads employed
in the design hang from the loom just within
reach of the boys' hands.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-38.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-38_th.jpg" alt="Boys Weaving a Carpet." title="Boys Weaving a Carpet." /></a></p>

<p class="illc">Cotton Cleaners.</p>

<p>The process of carpet-making is extremely
simple, consisting merely of a series of twisted&mdash;not
absolutely knotted&mdash;coloured worsted
threads, each passing round one of the main
threads of the foundation web. The catching-up
of each consecutive vertical thread in the web,
inserting the coloured worsted, giving it the
twist that makes it remain in its position, and
cutting it to the proper length, is done so quickly
by the tiny, supple fingers of the children that
it is impossible to see how it is done at all until
one requests them to do it slowly for one's
benefit. After each horizontal row of twisted
threads, a long horizontal thread is interwoven,
and then the lot is beaten down with a heavy
iron comb with a handle to it, not unlike a huge
hair-brush cleaner. There are different modes
of twisting the threads, and this constitutes the
chief characteristic of carpets made in one
province or another.</p>

<p>The labour involved in their manufacture is
enormous, and some carpets take several years to
manufacture. The children employed are made
to work very hard at the looms&mdash;seldom less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-315" id="Pg_1-315"></a>[<a href="./images/1-315.png">315</a>]</span>
than twelve or fourteen hours a day&mdash;and the
exertion upon their memory to remember the
design, which has taken them several months to
learn by heart, is great. The constant strain on
the eyes, which have to be kept fixed on each
successive vertical thread so as not to pick up
the wrong one, is very injurious to their sight.
Many of the children of the factories I visited
were sore-eyed, and there was hardly a poor
mite who did not rub his eyes with the back of
his hand when I asked him to suspend work for
a moment. The tension upon their pupils must
be enormous in the dim light.</p>

<p>Although made in a primitive method, the
carpet weaving of Persia is about the only
manufacture that deserves a first-class place in
the industries of Iran. The carpets still have a
certain artistic merit, although already contaminated
to no mean extent by European
commerciality. Instead of the beautiful and
everlasting vegetable dyes which were formerly
used for the worsted and silks, and the magnificent
blue, reds, greens, greys and browns, ghastly
aniline dyed threads&mdash;raw and hurtful to the
eye&mdash;are very commonly used now. Also, of
the carpets for export to Europe and America
the same care is not taken in the manufacture
as in the ancient carpets, and the bastard design
is often shockingly vulgarised to appease the
inartistic buyer.</p>

<p>But even with all these faults, Persian carpets,
if not to the eye of an expert, for all general
purposes are on the whole better than those of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-316" id="Pg_1-316"></a>[<a href="./images/1-316.png">316</a>]</span>
any other manufacture. They have still the
great advantage of being made entirely by hand
instead of by machinery. It is not unwise, before
buying a Persian carpet, to rub it well with a
white cloth. If it is aniline-dyed, some of the
colour will come off, but if the old Persian dyes
have been used no mark should remain on the
cloth. However, even without resorting to this,
it must be a very poor eye indeed that cannot recognise
at once the terrible raw colours of aniline
from the soft, delicious tones of vegetable dyes,
which time can only soften but never discolour.</p>

<p>To manufacture "ancient carpets" is one of
the most lucrative branches of modern Persian
carpet-making. The new carpets are spread in
the bazaar, in the middle of the street where it
is most crowded, and trampled upon for days or
weeks, according to the age required, foot-passengers
and their donkeys, mules and camels
making a point of treading on it in order to "add
age" to the manufacturer's goods. When
sufficiently worn down the carpet is removed,
brushed, and eventually sold for double or treble
its actual price owing to its antiquity!</p>

<p>There are some thirty different types of carpets
in Persia. The Kerman carpets are, to my mind,
the most beautiful I saw in Persia, in design,
colour and softness. They seem more original
and graceful, with conventional plant, flower and
bird representations of delicate and very varied
tints, and not so much geometrical design about
them as is the case in the majority of Persian
carpets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-317" id="Pg_1-317"></a>[<a href="./images/1-317.png">317</a>]</span></p>

<p>Less successful, in fact quite ugly, but quaint,
are those in which very large and ill-proportioned
figures are represented. One feels
Arab influence very strongly in a great many of
the Kerman designs. They say that Kerman
sheep have extremely soft and silky hair, and also
that the Kerman water possesses some chemical
qualities which are unsurpassable for obtaining
most perfect tones of colour with the various
dyes.</p>

<p>The principal carpet factory is in the Governor's
Palace, where old designs are faithfully copied,
and really excellent results obtained. The
present Governor, H. E. Ala-el-Mulk, and his
nephew take particular interest in the manufacture,
and devote much attention to the
carpets, which retain the ancient native characteristics,
and are hardly contaminated by foreign
influence.</p>

<p>The Isfahan silk carpets are also very beautiful,
but not quite so reposeful in colour nor graceful
in design. Those of Kurdistan are principally
small prayer rugs, rather vivid in colour, and
much used by Mahommedans in their morning
and evening salaams towards Mecca. In
Khorassan, Meshed, Sultanabad, Kaian (Kain)
and Birjand, some very thick carpets are made,
of excellent wear, but not so very artistic. In
the Birjand ones, brown camel-hair is a prevailing
colour, used too freely as a background, and
often taking away from the otherwise graceful
design. Sultanabad is probably the greatest
centre of carpet-making for export nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-318" id="Pg_1-318"></a>[<a href="./images/1-318.png">318</a>]</span>
every household possessing a loom. The firm
of Ziegler &amp; Co. is the most extensive buyer and
exporter of these carpets. The Herat (Afghanistan)
carpets are also renowned and find their
way mostly to Europe.</p>

<p>In Shiraz and Faristan we find the long
narrow rugs, as soft as velvet, and usually with
geometrical designs on them. Red, blue and
white are the prevalent colours.</p>

<p>It would be too long to enumerate all the places
where good carpets are made; but Kermanshah,
Tabriz, Yezd,&mdash;in fact, nearly all big
centres, make carpets, each having special
characteristics of their own, although in general
appearance bearing to the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unitiated'">uninitiated</ins> more or less
similar semblance.</p>

<p>The rugs made by the wandering tribes of
South-east and South-west Persia are quaint
and interesting. The Persian Beluch rugs are
somewhat minute and irregular in design, deep
in colour, with occasional discords of tones, but
they recommend themselves by being so strongly
made that it is almost impossible to wear them
out. They are generally small, being woven
inside their tents by the women.</p>

<p>In Northern Persia Turcoman carpets&mdash;the
most adaptable of all for European houses&mdash;are
seldom to be found now, as they are generally
bought up for Russia. Dark red, warm and
extremely soft is the striking note in these
carpets, and the design is quite sedate.</p>

<p>Carpets, except the cheaper ones, are seldom
sold in the bazaars nowadays. They are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-319" id="Pg_1-319"></a>[<a href="./images/1-319.png">319</a>]</span>
purchased on the looms. The best ones are
only made to order. There are, of course, a
few rug shops, and occasionally an old carpet finds
its way to a second-hand shop in the bazaar.</p>

<p>Next in attraction to carpets come the
jewellers' shops. The goldsmiths' and silversmiths'
shops are not very numerous in the
bazaars, nor, when we come to examine the work
carefully, do they have anything really worth
buying. The work is on good gold or silver of
pure quality, but, with few exceptions, is generally
clumsy in design and heavily executed.
Figures are attempted, with most inartistic
results, on silver cases and boxes. The frontage
of a goldsmith's shop has no great variety
of articles. Bracelets, rings, necklaces, tea and
coffee pots, stands for coffee cups, and enamelled
pipe heads; a silver kalian or two, an old cigar-box
full of turquoises, and another full of other
precious stones&mdash;or, rather, imitations of precious
stones&mdash;a little tray with forgeries of ancient
coins; that is about all. Pearls and diamonds and
really valuable stones are usually concealed in neat
paper parcels carried on the person by the jeweller
and produced on the demand of customers.</p>

<p>The swordmaker and gunsmith displays many
daggers and blades of local make and a great
number of obsolete Belgian and Russian revolvers;
also a good many Martini and Snider
rifles, which have found their way here from
India. Occasionally a good modern pistol or
gun is to be seen. Good rifles or revolvers find
a prompt sale in Persia at enormous figures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-320" id="Pg_1-320"></a>[<a href="./images/1-320.png">320</a>]</span>
Nearly every man in the country carries a rifle.
Had I chosen, I could have sold my rifles and
revolvers twenty times over when in Persia, the
sums offered me for them being two or three
times what I had paid for them myself. But
my rifles had been very faithful companions to
me; one, a 256&middot; Mannlicher, had been twice in
Tibet; the other, a 30&middot;30 take-down Winchester,
had accompanied me through the
Chinese campaign, and I would accept no sum
for them.</p>

<p>One is carried back a few score of years on
seeing the old rings for carrying gun-caps, and
also gunpowder flasks, and even old picturesque
flintlocks and matchlocks; but still, taking
things all round, it is rather interesting to note
that there is a considerable number of men in
Iran who are well-armed with serviceable cartridge
rifles, which they can use with accuracy.
Cartridge rifles are at a great premium, and
although their importation is not allowed, they
have found their way in considerable quantities
from all sides, but principally, they tell me,
from India, <i>via</i> the Gulf.</p>

<p>One of the notes of the bazaar is that in
almost every shop one sees a cage or two with
humming-birds. In the morning and evening a
male member of the family takes the cage and
birds out for a walk in the air and sun, for the
dulness and darkness of the bazaar, although
considered sufficiently good for Persians themselves,
is not regarded conducive to sound health
and happiness for their pets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> grand Avenue of Isfahan, much worn
and out of repair, and having several lines of
trees along its entire length of half a mile or so
down to the river, is one of the sights of the
ancient capital of Persia.</p>

<p>About half-way down the Avenue the famous
Madrassah is to be found. It has a massive,
handsome silver gate, in a somewhat dilapidated
condition at present, and showing evident marks
of thieving enterprise. At the entrance stand
fluted, tiled columns, with alabaster bases, in the
shape of vases some ten feet in height, while a
frieze of beautiful blue tiles with inscriptions
from the Koran, and other ornamentations, are to
be admired, even in their mutilated condition,
on tiles now sadly tumbling down.</p>

<p>So much for the exterior. Inside, the place
bears ample testimony to former grandeur and
splendour, but at present hopeless decay is
rampant here as everywhere else in Persia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-322" id="Pg_1-322"></a>[<a href="./images/1-322.png">322</a>]</span>
The Madrassah is attributed to Shah Sultan
Hussein, the founder of the Shrine at Kum, and
some magnificent bits of this great work yet
remain. One can gaze at the beautiful dome, of
a superb delicate greenish tint, surmounted by a
huge knob supposed to be of solid gold, and at
the two most delightful minarets, full of grace in
their lines and delicately refined in colour, with
lattice work at their summit.</p>

<p class="illc">Handsome Doorway in the Madrassah, Isfahan.</p>

<p>In the courts and gardens are some fine
old trees, amid a lot of uncouth vegetation,
while grass sprouts out between the slabs of
stone on the paths and wherever it should not
be; the walls all round, however, are magnificent,
being built of large green tiles with ornamentations
of graceful curves and the favourite leaf
pattern. In other places white ornamentations,
principally curves and yellow circles, are to be
noticed on dark blue tiles. In some of the
courts very handsome tiles with flower patterns
are still in good preservation.</p>

<p>There are in the college 160 rooms for
students to board and lodge. The buildings
have two storeys and nearly all have tiled fronts,
less elaborate than the minarets and dome, but
quite pretty, with quaint white verandahs.
When I visited the place there were only some
fifty students, of all ages, from children to old
men. Much time is devoted by them to
theological studies and some smattering of
geography and history.</p>

<p>One cannot leave Isfahan without visiting the
old Palace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-323" id="Pg_1-323"></a>[<a href="./images/1-323.png">323</a>]</span></p>

<p>In a garden formerly beautiful but semi-barren
and untidy now, on a pavement of slabs which
are no longer on the level with one another,
stands the Palace of the Twenty Columns, called
of "the forty columns," probably because the
twenty existing ones are reflected as in a mirror
in the long rectangular tank of water extending
between this palace and the present dwelling of
H. E. Zil-es-Sultan, Governor of Isfahan.
Distance lends much enchantment to everything
in Persia, and such is the case even in this
palace, probably the most tawdrily gorgeous
structure in north-west Persia.</p>

<p>The Palace is divided into two sections, the
open throne hall and the picture hall behind it.
The twenty octagonal columns of the open-air
hall were once inlaid with Venetian mirrors, and
still display bases of four grinning lions carved
in stone. But, on getting near them, one finds
that the bases are chipped off and damaged, the
glass almost all gone, and the foundation of the
columns only remains, painted dark-red. The
lower portion of the column, for some three feet,
is ornamented with painted flowers, red in blue
vases. The floor under the colonnade is paved
with bricks, and there is a raised platform for
the throne, reached by four stone steps.</p>

<p>There is a frieze here of graceful although
conventional floral decoration with gold leaves.
In the wall are two windows giving light to two
now empty rooms. The end central receptacle
or niche is gaudily ornamented with Venetian
looking-glasses cut in small triangles, and it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-324" id="Pg_1-324"></a>[<a href="./images/1-324.png">324</a>]</span>
a pretty ceiling with artichoke-leaf pattern
capitals in an upward crescendo of triangles.</p>

<p>The ceiling above the upper platform is made
entirely of mirrors with adornments in blue and
gold and glass, representing the sky, the sun,
and golden lions. Smaller suns also appear in the
ornamentation of the frieze. The ceiling above
the colonnade and the beams between the
columns are richly ornamented in blue, grey,
red, and gold. This ceiling is divided into
fifteen rectangles, the central panel having a
geometrical pattern of considerable beauty, in
which, as indeed throughout, the figure of the
sun is prominent.</p>

<p>The inner hall must have been a magnificent
room in its more flourishing days. It is now
used as a storeroom for banners, furniture, swords,
and spears, piled everywhere on the floor and
against the walls. One cannot see very well
what the lower portion of the walls is like,
owing to the quantity of things amassed all
round, and so covered with dust as not to invite
removal or even touch; but there seems to be
a frieze nine feet high with elaborate blue vases
on which the artist called into life gold flowers
and graceful leaves.</p>

<p>The large paintings are of considerable interest
apart from their historical value. In the
centre, facing the entrance door, we detect Nadir
Shah, the Napoleon of Persia, the leader of
80,000 men through Khorassan, Sistan, Kandahar
and Cabul. He is said to have crossed from
Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-325" id="Pg_1-325"></a>[<a href="./images/1-325.png">325</a>]</span>
Peshawar, and from there to Delhi, where his
presence led to a scene of loot and carnage. But
to him was certainly due the extension of the
Persian boundary to the Indus towards the East
and to the Oxus on the North. In the picture
he is represented on horseback with a great
following of elephants and turbaned figures.</p>

<p>To the right we have a fight, in which Shah
Ismail, who became Shah of Persia in 1499, is
the hero, and a crowd of Bokhara warriors and
Afghans the secondary figures. Evidently the
painting is to commemorate the great successes
obtained by Ismail in Khorassan, Samarkand and
Tashkend.</p>

<p>The third is a more peaceful scene&mdash;a Bokhara
dancing girl performing before Shah Tamasp,
eldest of four sons of Ismail and successor to his
throne. The Shah is represented entertaining
the Indian Emperor Humaiyun in 1543. The
lower portion of this picture is in good preservation,
but the upper part has been patched up
with hideous ornamentations of birds and flowers
on red ground.</p>

<p>Over the door Shah Ismail, wearing a white
turban, is represented riding a white horse and
carrying a good supply of arrows. The Shah
is in the act of killing a foe, and the painting
probably represents one of his heroic deeds at the
battle of Khoi against Salim.</p>

<p>To the right of the door there is a picture of
dancing and feasting, with Shah Abbas offering
drink in sign of friendship to Abdul Mohmek
Khan Osbek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-326" id="Pg_1-326"></a>[<a href="./images/1-326.png">326</a>]</span></p>

<p>Finally, to the left of the front door we have
pictorially the most pleasing of the whole series,
another scene of feasting, with the youthful
figure of Shah Abbas II. (died 1668), a man of
great pluck, but unfortunately given to drunkenness
and licentious living, which developed brutal
qualities in him. It was he who blinded many of
his relations by placing red-hot irons in front of
their eyes. Considering this too lenient a punishment
he ordered their eyes to be extracted
altogether. We see him now, sitting upon his
knees, garbed in a red tunic and turban. In
the foreground a most graceful dancing-girl, in
red and green robes, with a peculiar waistband,
and flying locks of hair. The artist has very
faithfully depicted the voluptuous twist of her
waist, much appreciated by Persians in dancing,
and he has also managed to infuse considerable
character into the musicians, the guitar man
and the followers of the Shah to the left of the
picture, as one looks at it, and the tambourine
figure to the right. Fruit and other refreshments
lie in profusion in vessels on the floor, elaborately
painted. This picture is rectangular, and is
probably not only the most artistic but the best
preserved of the lot.</p>

<p class="illc">The "Hall of the Forty Columns," Isfahan.</p>

<p>Great labour and patience in working out
details have been the aim of the artists of all
these pictures, rather than true effects of nature,
and the faces, hands, and poses are, of course, as
in most Persian paintings, conventionalized and
absolutely regardless of proportion, perspective,
fore-shortening or atmospherical influence or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-327" id="Pg_1-327"></a>[<a href="./images/1-327.png">327</a>]</span>
action&mdash;generally called aerial perspective. The
objection, common in nearly all countries,
England included, to shadows on the faces is
intensified a thousand-fold in Persian paintings,
and handicaps the artist to no mean degree in
his attempts to give relief to his figures. Moreover,
the manipulation and concentration of
light, and the art of composing a picture are not
understood in old Persian paintings, and the
result is that it is most difficult to see a picture
as an <i>ensemble</i>. The eye roams all over the
painting, attracted here by a patch of brilliant
yellow, there by another equally vivacious red,
here by some bright detail, there by something
else; and like so many ghosts in a haunted room
peep out the huge, black, almond-shaped eyes,
black-bearded heads, all over the picture, standing
like prominent patches out of the plane they are
painted on.</p>

<p>The pictures are, nevertheless, extremely interesting,
and from a Persian's standpoint magnificently
painted. Such is not the case with
the modern and shocking portrait of Nasr-ed-din
Shah, painted in the best oil colours in
European style, his Majesty wearing a gaudy
uniform with great wealth of gold and diamonds.
This would be a bad painting anywhere in Persia
or Europe.</p>

<p>The ceiling of this hall is really superb. It
has three domes, the centre one more lofty than
the two side ones. The higher dome is gilt,
and is most gracefully ornamented with a refined
leaf pattern and twelve gold stars, while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-328" id="Pg_1-328"></a>[<a href="./images/1-328.png">328</a>]</span>
other two cupolas are blue with a similar leaf
ornamentation in gold. There is much quaint
irregularity in the geometrical design of the
corners, shaped like a kite of prettily-arranged
gold, blue and green, while other corners are
red and light blue, with the sides of green
and gold of most delicate tones. These are
quite a violent contrast to the extravagant flaming
red patches directly over the paintings.</p>

<p>The hall is lighted by three windows at each
end near the lower arch of the side domes, and
three further double windows immediately under
them. There is one main entrance and three
exits (one large and two small) towards the
throne colonnade.</p>

<p>Through narrow lanes, along ditches of dirty
water, or between high mud walls, one comes
six miles to the west of Isfahan to one of the
most curious sights of Persia,&mdash;the quivering
minarets above the shrine and tomb of a saint.
These towers, according to Persians, are at least
eight centuries old.</p>

<p>Enclosed in a rectangular wall is the high
sacred domed tomb, and on either side of the
pointed arch of the Mesjid rise towards the sky
the two column-like minarets, with quadrangular
bases. A spiral staircase inside each minaret,
just wide enough to let a man through, conveys
one to the top, wherein four small windows are
to be found. By seizing the wall at one of the
apertures and shaking it violently an unpleasant
oscillation can be started, and continues of its
own accord, the minaret diverging from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-329" id="Pg_1-329"></a>[<a href="./images/1-329.png">329</a>]</span>
perpendicular as much as two inches on either
side. Presently the second minaret begins to
vibrate also in uniformity with the first, and the
vibration can be felt along the front roof-platform
between the two minarets, but not in other
parts of the structure. A large crack by the
side of one of the minarets which is said to
have existed from time immemorial foretells
that some day or other minarets and front wall
will come down, but it certainly speaks well for
the elasticity of minarets of 800 years ago that
they have stood up quivering so long.</p>

<p>The minarets are not very high, some thirty-five
feet above the roof of the Mesjid, or about
seventy-five feet from the ground. The whole
structure, of bricks and mud, is&mdash;barring the
dangerous crack&mdash;still in good preservation.
On the outside, the minarets are tiled in a graceful,
geometrical transverse pattern of dark and
light blue.</p>

<p>A visit to the sacred shrine of the quivering
minarets has miraculous powers&mdash;say the Persians&mdash;of
curing all diseases or protecting one against
them, hence the pilgrimage of a great number
of natives afflicted with all sorts of complaints.
Beggars in swarms are at the entrance waiting,
like hungry mosquitoes, to pounce upon the
casual visitor or customary pleasure-seeker of
Isfahan, for whom this spot is a favourite resort.</p>

<p class="illc">The Quivering Minarets near Isfahan.</p>

<p>A reliable map ought to be consulted in order
to understand the question properly, but it should
be remembered that it is ever dangerous to base
arguments on maps alone in discussing either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-331" id="Pg_1-331"></a>[<a href="./images/1-331.png">331</a>]</span>
political or commercial matters. Worse still is
the case when astoundingly incorrect maps such
as are generally manufactured in England are in
the hands of people unfamiliar with the real
topography and resources of a country.</p>

<p>To those who have travelled it is quite extraordinary
what an appalling mass of nonsensical
rubbish can be supplied to the public by politicians,
by newspaper penny-a-liners, and by home
royal geographo-parasites at large, who base their
arguments on such unsteady foundation. It is
quite sufficient for some people to open an atlas
and place their fingers on a surface of cobalt blue
paint in order to select strategical harbours, point
out roads upon which foreign armies can invade
India, trade routes which ought to be adopted in
preference to others, and so on, regardless of sea-depth,
currents, winds, shelter, and climatic conditions.
In the case of roads for invading armies,
such small trifles as hundreds of miles of desert,
impassable mountain ranges, lack of water, and
no fuel, are never considered! These are only
small trifles that do not signify&mdash;as they are not
marked on the maps&mdash;the special fancy of the
cartographer for larger or smaller type in the
nomenclature making cities and villages more or
less important to the student, or the excess of ink
upon one river course rather than another,
according to the cartographer's humour, making
that river quite navigable, notwithstanding that
in reality there may not be a river nor a city nor
village at all. We have flaming examples of this
in our Government maps of Persia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-332" id="Pg_1-332"></a>[<a href="./images/1-332.png">332</a>]</span></p>

<p>I myself have had an amusing controversy in
some of the London leading papers with no less
a person than the Secretary of a prominent
Geographical Society, who assured the public
that certain well-known peaks did not exist
because he could not find them (they happened
to be there all the same) on his map!</p>

<p>Such other trifles as the connecting of lakes by
imaginary rivers to maintain the reputation of a
scientific impostor, or the building of accurate
maps (<i>sic</i>) from badly-taken photographs&mdash;the
direction of which was not even recorded by the
distinguished photographers&mdash;are frauds too
commonly perpetrated on the innocent public by
certain so-called scientific societies, to be here
referred to. Although these frauds are treated
lightly, the harm they do to those who take them
seriously and to the public at large, who are
always ready blindly to follow anybody with
sufficient bounce, is enormous.</p>

<p>Without going into minor details, let us take
the burning question of the fast-expanding Russian
influence in the south of Persia. We are
assured that Russia wishes an outlet in the
Persian Gulf, and suspicions are strong that her
eye is set on Bandar Abbas. On the map it
certainly appears a most heavenly spot for a harbour,
and we hear from scribblers that it can be
made into a strong naval base and turned into a
formidable position. The trade from Meshed
and Khorassan and Teheran, Isfahan, Yezd, and
Kerman is with equal theoretical facility switched
on to this place. Even allowing that Russia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-333" id="Pg_1-333"></a>[<a href="./images/1-333.png">333</a>]</span>
should obtain a concession of this place&mdash;a most
unlikely thing to be asked for or conceded while
Persia remains an independent country&mdash;matters
would not be as simple for Russia as the man in
the street takes them to be.</p>

<p>It would first of all be necessary to construct
a railway connecting the Trans-Caspian line
with Bandar Abbas, a matter of enormous
expense and difficulty, and likely enough never
to be a profitable financial enterprise. The
political importance is dubious. A long railway
line unguarded in a foreign country could but be
of little practical value. It must be remembered
that Persia is a very thinly populated country,
with vast tracts of land, such as the Salt Desert,
almost absolutely uninhabited, and where the
construction of such a railway would involve
serious difficulties, owing to the lack of water
for several months of the year, intense heat,
shifting sands, and in some parts sudden inundations
during the short rainy season.</p>

<p>Moreover, Bandar Abbas itself, although
ideally situated on the maps, is far from being an
ideal harbour. The water is shallow, and there
is no safe shelter; the heat unbearable and unhealthy.
At enormous expense, of course, this
spot, like almost any other spot on any coast,
could be turned into a fair artificial harbour. The
native town itself&mdash;if it can be honoured with
such a name&mdash;consists of a few miserable mud
houses, with streets in which one sinks in filth
and mud. The inhabitants are the most miserable
and worst ruffians in Persia, together with some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-334" id="Pg_1-334"></a>[<a href="./images/1-334.png">334</a>]</span>
Hindoos. There is a European community of
less than half-a-dozen souls.</p>

<p>The <i>British India</i> and other coasting steamers
touch here, and therefore this has been made
the starting-point for caravans to Kerman and
Yezd and Sistan <i>via</i> Bam. But for Isfahan and
Teheran the more direct and shorter route <i>via</i>
Bushire is selected. The caravan road from
Bandar Abbas to Kerman and Yezd is extremely
bad and unsafe. Several times of late the track
has been blocked, and caravans robbed. During
1900, and since that date, the risk of travelling
on the road seems to have increased, and as it is
useless for Persians to try and obtain protection
or compensation from their own Government
the traffic not only has been diverted when
possible to other routes, principally Bushire, but
the rates for transport of goods inland had
at one time become almost prohibitive. In the
summer of 1900, it cost 18 tomans (about &pound;3
9<i>s.</i>) to convey 900 lbs. weight as far as Yezd,
but in the autumn the charges rose to 56 tomans
(about &pound;10 13<i>s.</i>) or more than three times as
much for the same weight of goods. Eventually
the rates were brought down to 22 tomans, but
only for a short time, after which they fluctuated
again up to 28 tomans. It was with the greatest
difficulty that loading camels could be obtained
at all, owing to the deficiency of exports, and
this partly accounted for the extortionate prices
demanded. An English gentleman whom I
met in Kerman told me that it was only at great
expense and trouble that he was able to procure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-335" id="Pg_1-335"></a>[<a href="./images/1-335.png">335</a>]</span>
camels to proceed from Bandar Abbas to Kerman,
and even then he had to leave all his luggage
behind to follow when other animals could
be obtained.</p>

<p>According to statistics furnished by the British
Vice-Consul, the exports of 1900 were half
those of 1899, the exact figures being &pound;202,232
for 1899; &pound;102,671 for 1900. Opium, which
had had the lead by far in previous years, fell
from &pound;48,367 to &pound;4,440. Raw cotton, however,
not only held its own but rose to a value
of &pound;18,692 from &pound;6,159 the previous year. In
the years 1888, 1889, 1890, and 1891 the
exports of raw cotton were abnormal, and rose
to about &pound;35,000 in 1890, the highest record
during the decade from 1888 to 1897.</p>

<p>Large quantities of henna and opium are also
exported from this spot, as it is the principal
outlet of the Kerman and Yezd districts, but
the trade may be said to be almost entirely in
British hands at present, and Russian influence
so far is infinitesimal.</p>

<p>We find that, next to opium, fruit and
vegetables, especially dates, constitute a large part
of the export, then wool, drugs and spices, salt,
carpets and woollen fabrics, piece goods, silk
(woven), seeds, skins and tanned leather, wheat
and cereals, and cotton raw and manufactured.
Perfumery&mdash;rose-water&mdash;was largely exported
from 1891 to 1896. The exportation of tobacco
seems to decrease, although it is now beginning
to look up again a little. Dyes and colouring
substances are also exported.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-336" id="Pg_1-336"></a>[<a href="./images/1-336.png">336</a>]</span></p>

<p>The value of imports is very nearly double
that of the exports. Cotton goods have the
lead by a long way, then come tea, and piece
goods, loaf-sugar, powdered sugar, indigo, metals,
wheat and cereals, spices, drugs, wool and woollen
fabrics, jute fabrics, cheap cutlery, coffee,
tobacco, mules, horses, donkeys, etc., in the
succession enumerated.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to find that the shipping increases
yearly at Bandar Abbas, and that, second
only to Persian vessels, the number of British
sailing vessels entering Bandar Abbas in 1900
was nearly double (48) of the previous year (28).
Steamers were in the proportion of 101 to 64.
Although in number of sailing vessels the
Persians have the priority, because of the great
number of small crafts, the total tonnage of the
Persian vessels was 5,320 tons against 75,440
tons in 1899, and 139,164 tons in 1900 British.</p>

<p>Turkish steamers occasionally ply to Bandar
Abbas and Muscat and also Arab small sailing
crafts.</p>

<p>It is rather curious to note that in 1899 the
imports into Bandar Abbas came entirely from
India, Great Britain and France, and in a small
measure from Muscat, Zanzibar, the Arab Coast,
Bahrain and Persian ports, whereas the following
year, 1900, the imports from India fell to less
than half their previous value, from &pound;435,261
to &pound;204,306, and from the United Kingdom
there was a diminution from &pound;86,197 to &pound;69,597;
whereas France doubled hers in 1900 and
other countries entered into competition. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-337" id="Pg_1-337"></a>[<a href="./images/1-337.png">337</a>]</span>
Chinese Empire, curiously enough, was the
strongest, to the value of &pound;18,419, presumably
with teas, and Austria-Hungary &pound;10,509. Germany
and Turkey imported to the value of
some &pound;2,174 and &pound;2,147 respectively. Belgium
&pound;2,254, Java &pound;7,819, Mauritius &pound;3,564, Muscat
&pound;692, the Canaries &pound;637, America &pound;600, and
Arabia &pound;494. Japan contributed to the amount
of &pound;305, Sweden &pound;273, Italy &pound;82, and Switzerland
the modest sum of &pound;8.</p>

<p>A most significant point is that Russia, with
all her alleged aims and designs, only contributed
to the small amount of &pound;572. Nothing was
exported from Bandar Abbas to Russia. It
would appear from this that at least commercially
Russia's position at Bandar Abbas was not much
to be feared as late as 1900. Since then a Russian
line of steamers has been established from the
Black Sea to the Persian Gulf ports, but I have
no accurate statistics at hand. It is said not to
be a financial success.</p>

<p>The establishment of Customs under Belgian
officials in 1900 caused some trouble at first, and
may have been responsible for a portion of the
falling-off in trade, but it is now agreed by
everybody that the system is carried on in a fair
and honest manner, preferable to the extortionate
fashion employed by the former speculators who
farmed out the Customs.</p>

<p>I rather doubt whether Russia's aim is even
directed towards Lingah, to the south-west of
Bandar Abbas, as has been supposed by others.
Although this port would afford a deeper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-338" id="Pg_1-338"></a>[<a href="./images/1-338.png">338</a>]</span>
better anchorage and a breakwater, it has the
same difficulties of approach by land from Russia
as Bandar Abbas&mdash;in fact, greater ones, being
further south.</p>

<p>Lingah is a more prosperous port than Bandar
Abbas, its exports being roughly two-thirds
larger than those of Bandar Abbas, and its imports
one-third in excess. In value the export and
import of pearls form the chief item, next come
wheat and cotton. Very little tea is disembarked
at Lingah, but dates and firearms were landed in
considerable quantities, especially in 1897.
Coffee and tobacco were more in demand here
than at Bandar Abbas, and metals were largely
imported. White sea-shells found their way in
huge quantities to Beluchistan, where the women
use them for decorating their persons. Bangles
and necklaces are made with them, and neck-bands
for the camels, horses and mules, as well
as ornamentations on the saddle bags. With
these two exceptions the imports and exports of
Lingah are made up of larger quantities of
articles similar to those brought to and from
Bandar Abbas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much for Bandar Abbas and Lingah. I
will not touch on Bushire, too well known to
English people, but Mahommerah may have a
special interest to us, and also to Russia. It is
rather curious to note that it has never struck the
British politician nor the newspaper writer that
Russia's aims, based usually on sound and
practical knowledge, might be focussed on this
port, which occupies the most favourable position
in the Persian Gulf for Russia's purposes. Even
strategically it is certainly as good as Bandar
Abbas, while commercially its advantages over
the latter port are a thousandfold greater.</p>

<p>These advantages are a navigable river, through
fertile country, instead of an almost impassable,
waterless desert, and a distance as the crow flies
from Russian territory to Mahommerah one-third
shorter than from Bandar Abbas. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-340" id="Pg_1-340"></a>[<a href="./images/1-340.png">340</a>]</span>
railway through the most populated and richest
part of Persia could easily be constructed to
Ahwaz. The climate is healthy though warm.</p>

<p>Another most curious fact which seems almost
incredible is that the British Government, through
ignorance or otherwise, by a policy of drift may
probably be the cause of helping Russia to reap
the benefit of British enterprise on the Karun
River, in the development of which a considerable
amount of British capital has already been
sunk. The importance, political and commercial,
of continuing the navigation of the Karun River
until it does become a financial success&mdash;which
it is bound to be as soon as the country all round
it is fully developed&mdash;is too obvious for me to
write at length upon it, but it cannot be expected
that a private company should bear the burden
and loss entirely for the good of the mother
country without any assistance from the home
Government.</p>

<p>The British firm, who run the steamers, with
much insight and praiseworthy enterprise improved
the existing caravan track from Isfahan
to Ahwaz on the Karun River, the point up to
which the river is navigable by steamers not
drawing more than four feet. They built two
fine suspension bridges, one over the Karun at
Godar-i-Balutak and the other, the Pul-Amarat
(or Built-bridge) constructed on the side of an
ancient masonry bridge. The track has thus
been rendered very easy and every assistance was
offered to caravans, while a regular service of
river steamers plied from Mahommerah to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-341" id="Pg_1-341"></a>[<a href="./images/1-341.png">341</a>]</span>
Ahwaz, to relieve the traffic by water. The
<span class="smcap">s.s.</span> <i>Blosse Lynch</i>, 250 tons, was sent up at first,
but was too large, so the <span class="smcap">s.s.</span> <i>Malamir</i>, 120 tons,
was specially built for the Karun navigation.</p>

<p>Matters were very prosperous at first, until
many obstacles came in the way. The road has
been open to traffic some three years. The first
year traffic was healthy and strong, but the second
year, owing to famine in Arabistan, the traffic
suddenly dropped and nothing would induce
muleteers to travel by that route. Although
they were offered as much as 100 (&pound;2) to 110
krans (&pound;2 4<i>s.</i>) per load from Isfahan to Ahwaz,
a distance of 17 stages&mdash;277 miles&mdash;they preferred
to take 70 krans (&pound;1 9<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>) to Bushire, a
journey of about 30 stages, over a distance of 510
miles.</p>

<p>The caravan men in Persia are curious people
to deal with, and it takes a very long time
to imbue their minds with new ideas. In the
case of the Ahwaz road it was partly conservatism
and fear instigated by the Mullahs that
prevented their taking loads to the steamers.</p>

<p>It was fully expected that the route could not
pay its way for at least five years from its inauguration,
and the British Government&mdash;which
at that time seemed to understand the value of
the undertaking&mdash;agreed to give in equal shares
with the Government of India a collective
guarantee against losses up to &pound;3,000 for the
first two years, then of &pound;2,000 for five years.
For some unaccountable reason the Government
of India, which the scheme mostly concerned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-342" id="Pg_1-342"></a>[<a href="./images/1-342.png">342</a>]</span>
dropped out, and the guarantee was further
reduced to &pound;1,000 payable by the home
Government only. As a result of this the
steamers have been run since at a considerable
loss, and had it not been for the patriotism of
Lynch Brothers, and the prospects to which they
still cling of a successful issue, the navigation of
the Karun would have already come to an untimely
end.</p>

<p>The principal article of export of any
importance was wheat, grown in enormous
quantities in the fertile plains of Arabistan; and
were its export legal, the export of grain would
be infinitely greater than the whole of the present
imports. But the Persian Government unfortunately
prohibited the export of grain from
Persia, nominally to allay and prevent famine in
the country, in fact to enrich local governors by
permitting illicit export. Consequently, the
peasants could not sell their produce in the
open market and had to sell it, accepting what
they could get from speculators at about half the
actual value. This led to the discontinuance
of the cultivation of wheat. When for three
years the exportation of grain was permitted,
the acreage under cultivation was enormous and
yielded very large returns, but as soon as the
prohibition was set in force it dwindled year by
year until it became approximately the fifth part
of what it originally was. On the top of all this
a severe drought occurred and a famine resulted.</p>

<p>It seems very likely that the British Government
may now fall out also and stop the meagre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-343" id="Pg_1-343"></a>[<a href="./images/1-343.png">343</a>]</span>
guarantee of &pound;1,000. This may have disastrous
results, for it cannot be expected that a
private firm will continue the navigation of the
Karun at a great loss. This is, in a few words,
what it may lead to. Should the British
abandon the work already done, Russia will step
in&mdash;she has had her eye upon the Karun more
than upon any other spot in Persia&mdash;and reap
the benefit of the money and labour that has
been spent by us. In the plain of Arabistan
Russian influence is not yet very far advanced,
but among the Backhtiaris it is spreading fast.
Intrigue is rampant. The Russian agents endeavour
to get the tribesmen into disgrace with
the Government and they succeed to a great
extent in their aim.</p>

<p>Isphandiar Khan, who has the title of Sirdar
Assad, is the head chief of the Backhtiaris, and
with his cousin Sephadar keeps going the various
branches of the family, but serious family
squabbles are very frequent and may eventually
cause division. The two above named men
manage to keep all together except Hadji-Riza
Kuli Khan, who is an opposing factor. He is
an uncle of Isphandiar Khan, and his rancour
arises from having been ousted from the chieftainship.
He is said to have fallen very badly
under Russian influence, and instigated his
followers to rebellion, the cause being, however,
put down not to family squabbles and jealousy&mdash;the
true causes&mdash;but to disapproval of the new
road and the influence exercised by it upon the
Backhtiari country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-344" id="Pg_1-344"></a>[<a href="./images/1-344.png">344</a>]</span></p>

<p>Only about one-fifth of foreign imports into
Mahommerah find their way up the Karun
River. It is certainly to be regretted that no
articles direct from the United Kingdom are
forced up the river. The trade with India in
1900 only amounted to some &pound;43,062 against
&pound;30,149 the previous year, France, Turkey, and
Egypt being the only other importers. The
total imports into Mahommerah for transhipment
to Karun ports amounted to &pound;59,194 in
1900, and showed a considerable increase on
1899.</p>

<p>Piece goods find their way up the river in
considerable quantities. Then loaf-sugar and
soft sugar are the principal articles of import;
dates, iron, and treacle come next; while various
metals, tea and matches come last.</p>

<p>In regard to local commerce the river trade
for 1900 was &pound;100,437, showing an increase of
&pound;37,449 upon the trade of 1899. This ought
to be regarded as satisfactory, considering the
slowness of Oriental races in moving from their
old grooves.</p>

<p>The down river trade falls very short of the
up river commerce, and consists mostly of wheat,
oil seeds, opium, wool, gum, flour, beans, cotton,
rice, tobacco, piece goods, glue. In 1900 the
decrease in the carriage of wheat was enormous,
and also the trade in oil seeds. Although gum
was carried down stream in much larger quantities,
owing to the yield being unusually abundant,
the price obtained was very poor, owing
to the falling London market. Gum Tragacanth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-345" id="Pg_1-345"></a>[<a href="./images/1-345.png">345</a>]</span>
was conveyed principally by the Isfahan-Ahwaz
route. Notwithstanding all this there was an
increase of &pound;17,000 in 1900 over the trade of
1899, which shows that the route is nevertheless
progressing and is worth cultivating.</p>

<p>Cotton goods, which are reimported from
India mostly by Parsee and Jewish firms,
originally come from Manchester and are in
great demand. They consist of grey shirtings,
prints (soft finish), lappets, imitation Turkey red,
Tanjibs and jaconets. Marseilles beetroot sugar
is holding its own against other cheaper sugars
imported lately and finds its way to Isfahan by
the Ahwaz road.</p>

<p>Caravans usually employ twenty days on the
Ahwaz-Isfahan journey, but the distance can
easily be covered in fifteen days and even less.
A fortnightly steamer is run by the Euphratis
and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to
Ahwaz.</p>

<p>Mahommerah exports chiefly to India, then
to Turkey, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong,
the Persian Gulf ports, Egypt and France. In
1900 the exports were to the value of &pound;115,359.
The imports were similar to those of Bandar
Abbas, viz.:&mdash;cotton goods, sugar, coffee, silk,
iron, tea, manufactured metal, thread, spices,
etc. They amounted to an aggregate sum of
&pound;281,570 in 1900, against &pound;202,492 in
1899.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-346" id="Pg_1-346"></a>[<a href="./images/1-346.png">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>If I have gone into details it is to show the
mistake made by the British Government in
letting such a valuable position, of absolute
vital importance to our interest, drift slowly but
surely into Russian hands. Russia's aims in the
Gulf are at present concentrated on the Karun
River; our movements are closely watched, and
nothing could be more probable than, that if we
abandon the Karun, Russia will at once fill our
place and turn the whole business into a
formidable success.</p>

<p>The Russian Government have now granted a
subsidy of &pound;5,000 per round voyage to the
Russian Steam Navigation to run three steamers
a year from Odessa to Bussorah, touching at all
the principal ports of the Persian Gulf. The
<span class="smcap">s.s.</span> <i>Kornilof</i> made two voyages in 1901,
arriving in Bussorah in April and November.
On her first voyage she landed most of her cargo
in Bushire, and only conveyed 8,000 cases of
petroleum and a quantity of wood for date boxes;
but on her second journey 16,500 cases of petroleum
were landed at Bussorah and a further
supply of wood, besides a great number of
samples of Russian products, such as flour, sugar
and matches. On the second return journey the
<i>Kornilof</i> took back to Odessa freight for two
thousand pounds from Bussorah, principally
dates, a cargo which had been previously carried
by British steamers to Port Said and then transhipped
for the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Russian boats excited
considerable interest among the natives and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-347" id="Pg_1-347"></a>[<a href="./images/1-347.png">347</a>]</span>
merchants, both British and indigenous. Comments
are superfluous on the grant given by the
Russian Government to further Russian trade,
and the wavering attitude of the British Government
in safeguarding interests already acquired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I only</span> halted a few days in Isfahan, during
which time I was the guest of Mr. Preece, the
British Consul-General. Mr. Preece's hospitality
and popularity are proverbial among Europeans
and natives all over Persia. A step in the
right direction was taken by the British Government
in making a Consulate-General in Isfahan,
and another good step was that of furnishing
the Consulate with a guard of mounted Indian
soldiers. Prestige and outward show go much
together in Persia, and no matter to what
extent one's private feelings may rebel at the
idea, we must make a display, I suppose.</p>

<p>We have in Mr. Preece a very able and
intellectual officer; a man who understands the
Persians thoroughly, and a gentleman of uncommon
tact and kindliness. His artistic taste
has served him well, so that the Consulate and
grounds have been rendered most comfortable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-349" id="Pg_1-349"></a>[<a href="./images/1-349.png">349</a>]</span>
and delightful, and the collections of carpets and
silver which he has made during his many years'
residence in Persia are very interesting.</p>

<p>It is true that Russian influence is spreading
fast towards the south, and that the establishment
of a Russian Consulate in Isfahan, with
its guard of Cossacks, has made considerable
impression on the population, but no doubt
Mr. Preece will be able to maintain British
prestige high, if the Government at home
show grit and enable him to do so.</p>

<p>It is most important, I think, to come to
some sound conclusion on the policy to be
followed towards Russia in Persia, either to
check her advance immediately and firmly, or
to come to some satisfactory agreement with
her so that her interests and ours may not
altogether clash; but it cannot be impressed
too often upon our minds that our present
policy of drift and wavering is most disastrous
to our interests. We have lost Northern Persia.
Southern Persia will soon slip from our grip
unless we pull up soon and open our eyes wide
to what is happening.</p>

<p>We place too much reliance on the fact that
Zil-es-Sultan, the Shah's brother and now
Governor of Isfahan, was once extremely pro-British.
We have a way of getting ideas into
our heads and nothing will drive them out
again, but we forget that things and people
change in Persia as everywhere else, and what
was accurate fifteen years ago may not be so
now. Also it must be remembered that Zil-es-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-350" id="Pg_1-350"></a>[<a href="./images/1-350.png">350</a>]</span>Sultan,
although in high power, does not
occupy the same high position politically as
before the late Shah's death. He and his
family are kept under strict control of the Shah,
and any pro-English ideas which they may still
have are discouraged, if not promptly eradicated.
His Highness's sons have been forbidden to be
educated in Europe or to travel abroad, although
a visit to Russia only might be allowed. Beyond
the secondary power of a High Governor, Zil-es-Sultan
has no other influence, and has to conform
to superior orders. He is now no longer
very young, and his popularity, although still
very great, cannot be said to be on the increase.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-44.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-44_th.jpg" alt="H. R. H. Zil-es-Sultan, Governor of Isfahan." title="H. R. H. Zil-es-Sultan, Governor of Isfahan." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"> <span class="smcap">H. R. H. Zil-es-Sultan</span>, Governor of Isfahan.</p>

<p>While in Isfahan I had an audience of his
Highness. One could not help being struck at
first glance by the powerful countenance of the
Prince, and the mixture of pride and worry
plainly depicted on his face. He spoke very
intelligently but was most guarded in his speech.
One of his sons Baharam Mirza&mdash;a wonderfully
clever young man, who spoke French and
English fluently although he had never been
out of Persia&mdash;interpreted. I was much impressed
by the kindliness of the Zil-es-Sultan
towards his children, and in return by the intense
respect, almost fear, of these towards their
father. After a pleasant visit and the usual compliments
and refreshments, coffee was brought,
the polite signal that the audience should come
to a close. The Prince accompanied the Consul
and myself to the door of the room&mdash;a most
unusual compliment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-351" id="Pg_1-351"></a>[<a href="./images/1-351.png">351</a>]</span></p>

<p>There were many soldiers, and servants and
attendants with silver-topped maces who escorted
us out of the grounds, where we found the
Consular guard again, and returned to the
Consulate.</p>

<p>Two days later I departed for Yezd. There
is no high road between the two cities; only a
mere track. No postal service and relays of
horses are stationed on the track, but, by giving
notice some days previous to one's departure,
horses can be sent out ahead from Isfahan to
various stages of the journey, until the Kashan-Nain-Yezd
road is met, on which post horses
can again be obtained at the Chappar Khanas.
This, however, involved so much uncertainty
and exorbitant expense that I preferred to
make up my own caravan of mules, the first
part of the journey being rather hilly.</p>

<p>On leaving Isfahan there are mountains to the
south, the Urchin range, and also to the east,
very rugged and with sharply defined edges.
To the north-east stand distant elevations, but
nothing can be seen due north. We go through
a great many ruins on leaving the city, and here,
too, as in other cities of Persia, one is once
more struck by the unimportant appearance of
the city from a little distance off. The green
dome of the Mosque, and four minarets are seen
rising on the north-east, five more slender
minarets like factory chimneys&mdash;one extremely
high&mdash;then everything else the colour of mud.</p>

<p>The traffic near the city is great. Hundreds
of donkeys and mules toddle along both towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-352" id="Pg_1-352"></a>[<a href="./images/1-352.png">352</a>]</span>
and away from the city gate. The dust is
appalling. There is nothing more tantalizing
than the long stretches of uninteresting country
to be traversed in Persia, where, much as one
tries, there is nothing to rest one's eye upon;
so it is with great relief&mdash;almost joy&mdash;that we
come now to something new in the scenery, in
the shape of architecture&mdash;a great number of
most peculiar towers.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-45.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-45_th.jpg" alt="Agriculture and Pigeon Towers near Isfahan." title="Agriculture and Pigeon Towers near Isfahan." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Agriculture and Pigeon Towers near Isfahan.</p>

<p>These are the pigeon towers&mdash;a great institution
in Central Persia. They are cylindrical in
shape, with castellated top, and are solidly built
with massive walls. They stand no less than
thirty to forty feet in height, and possess a
central well in which the guano is collected&mdash;the
object for which the towers are erected. A
quadrangular house on the top, and innumerable
small cells, where pigeons lay their eggs and
breed their young, are constructed all round the
tower. These towers are quite formidable
looking structures, and are so numerous, particularly
in the neighbourhood of Isfahan, as
to give the country quite a strongly fortified
appearance. The guano is removed once a
year. After passing Khorasgun, at Ghiavaz&mdash;a
small village&mdash;one could count as many as
twenty-four of these pigeon houses.</p>

<p>Some amusement could be got from the way
the Persian telegraph line had been laid between
Isfahan and Yezd, <i>via</i> Nain. There were no
two poles of the same height or shape; some
were five or six feet long, others ten or fifteen;&mdash;some
were straight, some crooked; some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-353" id="Pg_1-353"></a>[<a href="./images/1-353.png">353</a>]</span>
most irregular knobby shapes. As to the wire,
when it did happen to be supported on the pole
it was not fastened to an insulator, as one would
expect, but merely rested on a nail, or in an
indentation in the wood. For hundreds of
yards at a time the wire lay on the ground, and
the poles rested by its side or across it. Telegrams
sent by these Persian lines, I was told,
take several days to reach their destination, if
they ever do reach at all; and are usually
entrusted for conveyance, not to the wire, but
to caravan men happening to travel in that
particular direction, or to messengers specially
despatched from one city to the other.</p>

<p>Some two farsakhs from Isfahan we went
through a passage where the hills nearly meet,
after which we entered a flat plain, barren and
ugly. In the distance to the south-east lay a
line of blackish trees, and another in front of us
in the direction we were travelling, due east.
Then we saw another bunch of pigeon
towers.</p>

<p>Leaving behind the hills nearer to us to the
north-west, west, and south-west, and the more
distant and most fantastically shaped range to
the south, my mules gradually descend into the
plain. For an angle of 40&deg; from east to S.S.E.
no hills are visible to the naked eye, but there
is a long range of comparatively low hills
encircling us from N.N.W. to S.S.E. and N.E.
of the observer, the highest points being at
80&deg; (almost N.E.E.). To the north we have
a long line of <i>kanats</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-354" id="Pg_1-354"></a>[<a href="./images/1-354.png">354</a>]</span></p>

<p>Following the drunken row of telegraph
poles we arrive at Gullahbad (Gulnabad)&mdash;a
village in ruins. From this point for some
distance the soil is covered with a deposit of
salt, giving the appearance of a snow-clad landscape,
in sharp contrast with the terrific heat
prevailing at the time. This road is impassable
during the rainy weather. As one nears the
hills to the N.E. tufts of grass of an an&aelig;mic
green cover the ground (altitude 5,250 feet).</p>

<p>Under a scorching sun we reached Saigsi (8
farsakhs from Isfahan) at six o'clock in the
afternoon, and put up in the large caravanserai
with two rooms up stairs and ten down below
around the courtyard. The difference in the
behaviour of the natives upon roads on which
Europeans do not frequently travel could be
detected at once here. One met with the
greatest civility and simplicity of manner and,
above all, honesty, which one seldom finds where
European visitors are more common.</p>

<p>There are few countries where the facial
types vary more than in Persia. The individuals
of nearly each town, each village, have peculiar
characteristics of their own. At Saigsi, for
instance, only 32 miles from Isfahan, we find an
absolutely different type of head, with abnormally
large mouth and widely-expanded nostrils,
the eyes wide apart, and the brow overhanging.
The latter may be caused by the constant
brilliant refraction of the white soil in the
glare of the sun (altitude of Saigsi 5,100
feet).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-355" id="Pg_1-355"></a>[<a href="./images/1-355.png">355</a>]</span></p>

<p>About four miles east of Saigsi and north of
the track we come across five curious parallel
lines of mud-heaps or dunes stretching from
north to south. Each of these heaps is precisely
where there is a gap in the mountain range to
the north of it, and each has the appearance of
having been gradually deposited there by a
current passing through these gaps when the
whole of this plain was the sea-bottom. These
mud heaps are flat-topped and vary from 20 to
40 feet in height, the central row of all being
the highest of the series. This is a grand place
for wonderful effects of mirage all round us.
To the W. spreads a beautiful lake in the
depression of the plain&mdash;as complete an optical
deception as it is possible to conceive, for in
reality there is no lake at all<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ','">.</ins></p>

<p>Water is not at all plentiful here. One finds
a reservoir made for caravans along this track.
It is a tank 25 feet by 10 feet sunk deep into the
ground and roofed over with a vault. The
water is sent to it by means of a channel from
the small village of Vartan north of it.</p>

<p>We gradually rise to 5,550 feet and again we
have before us another beautiful effect of mirage
in the shape of a magnificent lake with a
village and cluster of trees apparently suspended
in the air. My caravan man assures me that
the village, which appears quite close by, is
many miles off.</p>

<p>Long rows of <i>kanats</i>, ancient and modern, to
the south-east warn us of the approach of a
small town, and on the road plenty of skeletons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-356" id="Pg_1-356"></a>[<a href="./images/1-356.png">356</a>]</span>
of camels, donkeys, and mules may be seen.
Fodder is very scarce upon this track, and
many animals have to die of starvation. Also
animals caught here during the rains cannot proceed
in the sinking soft ground, and eventually
die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the afternoon Khupah (altitude 5,920
feet) was reached, with its very large and dirty
caravanserai to the west, just outside the town
wall. From the roof&mdash;the only clean part of
the hostelry&mdash;one obtains a good panoramic
view of the town. It is built in a most irregular
shape, and is encircled by a castellated mud wall
with round turrets. There is a humble dome of
a mosque rising somewhat higher than all the
other little domes above each dwelling.</p>

<p>Feeble attempts at raising a bazaar have been
made on different sites in the town, where bits of
arcades have been erected, but there are no signs
about the place of a flourishing industry or trade.
The majority of houses, especially in the northern
part of the city, are in ruins. The principal
thoroughfare is picturesque enough, and on the
occasion of my visit looked particularly attractive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-358" id="Pg_1-358"></a>[<a href="./images/1-358.png">358</a>]</span>
to me, with its huge trays of delicious grapes.
They were most refreshing to eat in the terrific
heat of the day. One peculiarity of the place is
that most doorways of houses are sunk&mdash;generally
from one to three feet&mdash;below the level of the
street.</p>

<p>Between the caravanserai and the city is a
sunken well with flat roof and four ventilating
shafts to keep the water cool. Further away,
are seven more buildings&mdash;probably dead-houses&mdash;and
a garden. The little range north of the
city is quite low, and has in front of it a
pyramidal dune&mdash;a similar deposit to those we
have already noticed to the north-west in the
morning on our march to this place, but much
higher.</p>

<p>South of the town many trees and verdant
gardens are visible, and to the West the immense
stretch of flat&mdash;some sixty miles of it that we
had travelled over from Isfahan.</p>

<p>For want of a better amusement I sat on the
roof to watch the sunset, while Sadek cooked my
dinner. The nearer hills, of a bright cobalt blue,
faded into a light grey in the distance, the sky
shone in a warm cadmium yellow, and beneath
stretched the plain, of a dark-brown bluish
colour, uninterrupted for miles and miles, were
it not for one or two tumbled-down huts in
the immediate foreground, and a long, snake-like
track winding its way across the expanse until it
lost itself in the dim distance.</p>

<p>Directly below, in the courtyard of the
caravanserai, four camels squatted round a cloth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-359" id="Pg_1-359"></a>[<a href="./images/1-359.png">359</a>]</span>
on which was served straw mixed with cotton
seeds, that gave flavour to their meal. The
camels slowly ground their food, moving their
lower jaws sideways from right to left, instead
of up and down as is usual in most other
animals; and some of the caravan men placidly
smoked their kalians, while others packed up
their bundles to make ready for their departure
as soon as the moon should rise. In another
corner of the courtyard my own caravan man
groomed the mules, and around a big flame a
little further off a crowd of admiring natives
gazed open-mouthed at Sadek boiling a chicken
and vegetables for my special benefit.</p>

<p>We were to make a night march, as the heat
of the day was too great to travel in. At three
in the morning, yawning and stretching our
limbs when we were roused by the charvadar,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
we got on the mules and made our departure.
The cold was intense, and the wind blowing
with all its might from the west. Six miles off
we passed Kamalbek, then six miles further the
large village of Moshkianuh in ruins, with a few
green trees near it.</p>

<p>The plain on which we are travelling rises
gently up to the village of Kudeshk at the foot
of the mountain (altitude 6,750 feet). We
ascend gradually between hills to the north and
south and find ourselves in another flat valley,
about three quarters of a mile broad and one mile
and a half long. (Altitude 7,200 feet.) We
are surrounded by hills, and find two villages,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-360" id="Pg_1-360"></a>[<a href="./images/1-360.png">360</a>]</span>
one to the east, the other to the west of the
valley. The latter possesses buildings with
masonry walls instead of the usual mud ones,
and also masonry enclosures round wheat-fields
and fruit-tree groves.</p>

<p>We continue to rise until the highest point of
the plain is reached, 7,620 feet. Two or three
smaller hamlets are found in the centre of the
plain.</p>

<p>A second basin is found on proceeding east,
with here and there miserable clusters of trees;
otherwise everything is as barren as barren could
be. On the reddish hills the rocky portion
shows through at the summit only, whereas the
bases are enveloped in a covering of sand and
salt. To the north the Fishark and Sara mountain
range extends in a general direction of
N.W. to S.E., and its formation is quite interesting.
Due north of us the eye is attracted by a
peculiar hill, a double cone, two pointed, and
much redder in colour than the hills near it.</p>

<p>On nearing the mountains many small villages
appear. Yazih village has a solid stone wall
round it. Wheat is cultivated by the natives,
good water being obtainable here in small but
limpid streams. Then we have the old village
of Lhas, now rejoicing in the new name of
Mazemullahmat, and near it, Fezahbad, where I
halted.</p>

<p>I strolled in the afternoon a mile from the
latter village to the pass, 8,000 feet above sea
level. Directly in front of the pass (at 110&deg;
bearings magnetic) stands a high peak, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-361" id="Pg_1-361"></a>[<a href="./images/1-361.png">361</a>]</span>
beyond it to the right of the observer (at 140&deg;
b.m.) another and higher summit.</p>

<p>We leave behind to the W.N.W. the high
Sara mountain range, no peaks of which, I
estimated, rose above 10,000 feet. W.N.W. (at
280&deg; b.m.) is a most curious conical hill, standing
isolated and very high above the plain.</p>

<p>Among the most common sights of these
parts are the whirlwinds&mdash;the <i>tourbillons</i>,&mdash;each
revolving with terrific rapidity round its own
axis and raising to the sky a cylindrical column
of dust. They further move along the country
in a spasmodic manner, but never so fast that
they cannot be avoided. The diameter of the
wind columns I observed by the dust carried
with it, varied from 3 feet to 20 feet.</p>

<p>The mountains we are travelling on are said to
be somewhat unsafe, the villagers being given to
attacking caravans, and robber bands coming
here for shelter when it becomes unsafe for them
to be on the Kashan-Yezd high road. In fact,
while resting in the house of Haji-Mulla Ahmed
at Fezahbad, a curious lot of men appeared,
who, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Sadek
and Haji, broke into the house in a most
boisterous manner, demanding food of the landlord.
They were armed with revolvers and old
Martini rifles, and had plenty of cartridges about
their persons. They seemed quite taken aback to
find a European inside the room. They changed
their attitude at once, and became quite polite.</p>

<p>I entertained them to tea, of which they
drank gallons. I cannot say that I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-362" id="Pg_1-362"></a>[<a href="./images/1-362.png">362</a>]</span>
particularly charmed with their faces, but their
manner was certainly most courteous. They
showed me their rifles&mdash;English Martinis with
additional gold ornamentations of lion and sun,
such as one sees in thousands all over Persia. I
asked them where they got them from. They
said they came from the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Haji Mulla Ahmed, the founder of the village,
was a fine old fellow with a kindly face, eyes
shining like beads under an overhanging brow,
and a crimson beard dyed with henna. He
appeared rather sulky at this unwonted visit,
and more sulky still later when the visitors left
me and he had to provide food for them. He
said that the robbers frequently called upon him,
and were a great drain on his supplies.</p>

<p>When we left at 1.45 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to go across the
pass, he advised Sadek and myself to load our
rifles and keep a sharp look-out. As I had
already measured the altitude of the pass in the
afternoon I had no particular object in keeping
awake, so I slung the rifle to my saddle and
dozed off on my mule as we were slowly winding
our way up to the summit. The long night
marches were so dreary and the sound of the
mules' bells so monotonous that it was most
difficult to keep awake. One gradually learns to
balance one's self quite well on the saddle while
asleep, and it does shorten the long hours of
the night very considerably. Occasionally one
wakes up abruptly with a jolt, and one fancies that
one is just about to tumble over, but although I
suppose I must have ridden in my life hundreds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-363" id="Pg_1-363"></a>[<a href="./images/1-363.png">363</a>]</span>
of miles while asleep on the saddle, I have never
once had a fall in the natural course of affairs. The
animals, too, are generally so intelligent that
they do for one the balancing required and
manage to keep under the rider.</p>

<p>On that particular night I was extremely
sleepy. I opened my eyes for a second when we
reached the pass and began to descend on the
other side, but sleepiness overcame me again.
I was riding the first mule in the caravan. Unexpectedly
I received a fearful blow in the face,
and I was very nearly torn off the saddle.
There was a curious metallic buzzing resounding
in the air, and before I had time to warn those
that came after, Sadek, who came next, was
knocked down, and the mules, frightened at this
unusual occurrence, stampeded down the steep
incline. It was the telegraph wire hanging loose
right across the road that had caused the accident.
The road was in zig-zag, and was crossed several
times by the wire which was laid more or less in
a straight line. But this, of course, I did not
know, so a few minutes later, before we had
time to bring the runaway mules to a stop, the
wire, unseen, was again met with a foot or so
above the ground. It caught the mules on the
legs, and as they were tied to one another, and
were carried on by the impetus of the pace at
which we were going, all the animals tumbled
down one on the top of the other in a heap.
The packs got mercilessly undone, and it took
us the best part of an hour to disentangle all and
get things straight again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-364" id="Pg_1-364"></a>[<a href="./images/1-364.png">364</a>]</span></p>

<p>The cold was bitter. Some two miles East of
the pass there were two roads, one leading to
Nain, the other to Nao Gombes. We took the
latter and shorter route, and with some sense of
relief now we left the telegraph line, which
proceeds to Nain.</p>

<p>On the plateau east of the pass, we found six
small villages, the most eastern&mdash;Eshratawat
(Ishratabad)&mdash;being the largest (altitude 6,800
ft.). When the sun was about to rise we more
clearly distinguished a grey, sombre, mountainous
mass to the east, sharply indented at its summit,
like the teeth of a gigantic saw, and ending
abruptly on the northern terminus.</p>

<p>We had come between mountains, and some
twelve miles from Fezahbad we reached Kudarz
(altitude 6,580 ft.), a village situated at the foot
of the range we had crossed. As the sun peeped
above the mountains close by to the east a large
plain disclosed itself before the observer. A long
mountain range, bluish and indistinct, could just
be perceived in the distance, bounding the plain
to the north. Some low, semi-spherical and a
few conical hills, and also a somewhat higher
and rugged rocky elevation, were found on entering
the plain from the west.</p>

<p>Oskholun village lies in the plain 16 miles
from Fezahbad. At the foot of the mountains
on one's right one notices a curious deposit of
sand and gravel, cushion shaped, rising in a
gentle incline up the mountain side to a height
of 150 feet. It would be interesting to find out
exactly how these accumulations have formed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-365" id="Pg_1-365"></a>[<a href="./images/1-365.png">365</a>]</span>
and whether the wind or water or both are
responsible for them.</p>

<p>On arriving at Bambis (altitude 5,660 ft.)
Sadek was in a great state of mind to find a
suitable house where we could put up, as there
were no caravanserais. Several of the principal
people in the town offered me their own houses,
and eventually, after careful inspection, I accepted
the cleanest.</p>

<p>Of course, in small, out-of-the-way villages no
great luxury could be expected even in dwellings
of well-to-do people, but after entering by a miserable
door and going through a filthy passage, one
came to a nice little court with an ornamental
tank of somewhat fetid water. Swarms of mosquitoes
rose from the floating leaves of the water
plants as soon as we appeared and gave us a very
warm reception. In a few seconds we were
stung all over.</p>

<p>The women folks were made to stampede to
the upper storey on our arrival, where they remained
concealed while we stayed in the house,
and the younger male members of the family
hastily removed all the bedding and personal
belongings from the principal room, which I
was to occupy. Clouds of dust were raised
when an attempt was made to sweep the dried
mud floor. Out of the windows of the upper
storey the women flung handsome carpets, which
Sadek duly spread upon the floor.</p>

<p>The room was a very nice one, plastered all
over and painted white, enriched with adhering
dried leaves of red roses forming a design upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-366" id="Pg_1-366"></a>[<a href="./images/1-366.png">366</a>]</span>
the ceiling. There were nine receptacles in the
walls, and four more in the sides of the chimney
piece. Next to this room was another similar
one, and opposite in the courtyard a kind of
alcove was used as a kitchen. It had a raised
part of mud bricks some three feet high and
about as broad, on which was fixed the weaving
loom that stretched right across the court when
in use. A hole was made in the raised portion,
in which the weaver sat when at work, so as
to keep the legs under the loom.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-46.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-46_th.jpg" alt="Persian Spinning Wheels and Weaving Looms." title="Persian Spinning Wheels and Weaving Looms." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Persian Spinning Wheels and Weaving Looms.</p>

<p>The loom is simple enough, the two sets of
long horizontal threads being kept at high
tension by an iron bar fixed into the cylindrical
wooden rollers, round which the threads are
rolled. There is then a vertical arrangement for
moving the long horizontal sets of threads
alternately up and down by means of pedals, a
cross thread being passed between them with a
spool, and beaten home each time with the large
comb suspended in a vertical position. The
threads are kept in position by two additional
combs which represent the width of the cloth,
and in which each horizontal thread is kept
firm in its central position by a clever device of
inverted loops between which it is passed and
clenched tight. The cloth is rolled round a
wooden cylinder. It is extremely strong and
durable. Almost each house has a weaving loom.</p>

<p>On one side of the court was a recess in the
wall for valuables. The padlock was closed by
means of a screw. By the side of the kitchen
one found the lumber and refuse room, and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-367" id="Pg_1-367"></a>[<a href="./images/1-367.png">367</a>]</span>
were corresponding arrangements on the floor
above. Unlike other Persian houses this was
lighted by windows with neat woodwork, instead
of by the usual skylight hole in the dome of the
room.</p>

<p>The natives at this village were very handsome.
There was a touch of the Afghan type in the men,
and the women had fine faces with magnificent
eyes. One found firm mouths with well-cut and
properly developed lips, in contrast to the weak,
drooping mouths of the people one had met in
the western cities; and the noses were finely
chiselled, with well-defined nostrils. There was
no unsteadiness in the eyes, so common to the
Persians of the north-west,&mdash;and these fellows
consequently presented quite an honest appearance,
while the overhanging brow added a look
of pensiveness. The skull was peculiarly formed,
slanting upwards considerably from the forehead
to an abnormal height, and giving the cranium
an elongated shape. The ears, too, generally
malformed or under-developed in most Persians,
were better shaped in these people, although by
no means perfect. They, nevertheless, showed a
certain refinement of blood and race.</p>

<p>In the matter of men's clothing it was gratifying
to find the ugly pleated frockcoats discarded&mdash;or,
rather, never adopted&mdash;and long picturesque
shirts and ample trousers worn instead, held
together by a kamarband. Over all was thrown
a brown burnous, not unlike that of the Bedouins,
and the head was wound in an ample turban
of the Hindoo pattern.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-368" id="Pg_1-368"></a>[<a href="./images/1-368.png">368</a>]</span></p>

<p>Children wore short coats ornamented with
embroidery and shells at the back and pretty
silver buttons in front. Their little caps, too,
were embellished with shells, beads, or gold
braiding.</p>

<p>Nearly all male natives, old and young,
suffered from complaints of the eyes, but not so
the women,&mdash;probably because they spent most
of the time in the house and did not expose
themselves to the glare of the sun and salty
dust, which seemed to be the principal cause of
severe inflammation of the eyes.</p>

<p>Bambis village was greatly dependent upon
Isfahan for its provisions, and therefore everything
was very dear. Excellent vegetables,
<i>shalga</i>, <i>sardek</i>, <i>churconda</i>, and pomegranates were
nevertheless grown, by means of a most elaborate
and ingenious way of irrigation, but the water
was very brackish and dirty. Felt filters were
occasionally used by the natives for purifying the
drinking water.</p>

<p>There were a number of Sayids living at Bambis,
who looked picturesque in their handsome
green turbans; they were men of a splendid
physique, very virile, simple in manner, serious
and dignified, and were held in much respect by
their fellow villagers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left Bambis at ten o'clock on Sunday
evening and travelled on a flat plain the whole
night. One village (Arakan) was passed, and
eventually we entered the Teheran-Kashan-Yezd
high road which we struck at Nao Gombes.
Here there were a Chappar Khana and an
ancient Caravanserai&mdash;the latter said to be of the
time of Shah Abbas&mdash;but we did not stop, and
continued our journey along a broad, immense
stretch of flat country consisting of sand and
gravel.</p>

<p>My men were fast asleep on their mules, but
the animals seemed to know their way well, as
they had been on this road many times before.
The night was extremely cold. We were now
at an altitude of 4,240 feet in what is called the
"Kevir," a small salt desert plain, enclosed to
the south-west of the track by the south-easterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-370" id="Pg_1-370"></a>[<a href="./images/1-370.png">370</a>]</span>
continuation of the Sara and Keble range; to
the north-east by the Mehradji, Turkemani, and
Duldul mountains; and to the north by the
Aparek and Abiane mountains.</p>

<p>During the rainy weather the drainage of the
latter two ranges is carried in large volumes into
the plain between them, and eventually into the
Kevir, in which it loses itself. To the south-east
the Ardakan mountains form a barrier, having,
however, a gap between them and the Andjile
mountains, through which the road crosses in a
south-easterly direction.</p>

<p>Antimony is found in the Mehradji mountains,
and copper, lead (in several localities), nickel
and antimony in the Anarek region. Silver is
said to have been found in the Andjile. To the
north-east, almost in the middle of the Kevir,
stands the isolated high mountain of Siakuh.</p>

<p>Thirty-six miles from Bambis we reached
Chanoh, a most desolate place, with a rest-house
in ruins and a couple of suspicious-looking wells.
We arrived here at eight in the morning, after
having travelled since ten o'clock the previous
evening, but we only allowed ourselves and our
mules four hours' rest for breakfast, and we were
again in the saddle at noon.</p>

<p>There is nothing to interest the traveller on
this part of the road except an occasional passing
caravan, and the scenery is dreary beyond words.
Long, long stretches of flat, uninteresting sand
and gravel, or sand alone in places. On nearing
the spot where the track passes between the
Andjile and Ardakan mountains we find sand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-371" id="Pg_1-371"></a>[<a href="./images/1-371.png">371</a>]</span>
deposits stretching out for nearly two miles from
the mountain ranges to the south-west and south.</p>

<p>Shehrawat (Shehrabad) village differs from
most we have seen in the shape of its few roofs,
which are semi-cylindrical, like a vault, and not
semi-spherical. A mud tower rises above them,
and there are a few fields and some fruit-trees
near the habitations.</p>

<p>About a mile further, more sand dunes are to
be found, and a long row of kanats carrying
water to the village of Nasirabad, half a mile
east of the track. Further on we come upon
an open canal, and we can perceive a village
about two miles distant, also to the east of the
track.</p>

<p>Just before arriving at Agdah the earth has
positively been disembowelled in search of water,
so numerous are the kanats of all sizes and
depths among which we wind our way. The
large village of Agdah itself stands on a prominence
(4,080 ft.) against a background of mountains,
and is embellished with a great many
orchards tidily walled round. It is a famous
place for pomegranates, which are really delicious.
As usual a number of ruined houses surround
those still standing, and as we skirt the village
wall over 30 feet high we observe some picturesque
high round towers.</p>

<p>The telegraph wire (which we had met again
at Nao Gombes) was here quite an amusing
sight. In the neighbourhood of the village it
was highly decorated with rags of all colours,
and with stones tied to long strings which, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-372" id="Pg_1-372"></a>[<a href="./images/1-372.png">372</a>]</span>
thrown up, wind themselves round and remain
entangled in the wire.</p>

<p>There were some 300 habitations in Agdah,
the principal one with a large quadrangular
tower, being that of the Governor; but both the
Chappar khana and the caravanserai were the
filthiest we had so far encountered. A number
of Sayids lived here.</p>

<p>We halted at four in the afternoon on Monday,
October 19th. The mules were so tired that I
decided to give them twelve hours' rest. It may
be noticed that we had travelled from ten o'clock
the previous evening until four in the afternoon&mdash;eighteen
hours&mdash;with only four hours' rest,&mdash;quite
good going for caravan marching. The mules
were excellent.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on the Tuesday we rode out of the
caravanserai, and still travelled south-east on a
flat gravel plain, with the high Ardakan Mountains
to the east. Fourteen miles or so from
Agdah the country became undulating with
large pebble stones washed down from the mountain-sides.
Cairns of stone had been erected on
the first hillock we came to near the road. We
passed two villages, one on the track, the other
about a mile north of it, and near this latter two
or three smaller hamlets were situated.</p>

<p>Sixteen miles from Agdah we halted for an
hour or so at the village of Kiafteh (Chaftah)&mdash;altitude
3,960 feet&mdash;with its round tower and
the Mosque of Semur-ed-din one mile north of
it. Here there was a Chappar khana. The
labourers wore a short blue shirt and ample<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-373" id="Pg_1-373"></a>[<a href="./images/1-373.png">373</a>]</span>
trousers, with white turban and white shoes.
Having partaken of a hearty breakfast we were
off again on the road in the broiling sun at
10.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Beautiful effects of mirage were
before us like splendid lakes, with the mountains
reflected into them, and little islands.</p>

<p>As we go through the gap in the mountains
that are now to the south-west and north-east
of us the plain narrows to a width of some four
miles, and the direction of the track is east-south-east.
To the south-east the hillocks of
a low range stretch as far as the mountains
on the south-west, and several parallel ranges lie
on the north-east. South, very far off, is the
high Shirkuh mountain.</p>

<p>Eight miles from Kiafteh we cross over the
low hill range by a pass (4,090 ft.) about
100 feet above the plain (3,990 ft.). There is
a mournful look about the soil of black sand,
and also about the gloomy shingle hill range
extending from the north-east to the south-west.
The black underlying rock where exposed to the
air shows numberless holes corroded in it, as by
the action of moving salt water. An inexplicable
isolated hill stands in the centre of the valley,
which here is not perfectly flat, but in a gentle
incline, higher at its south-western extremity
than at its north-eastern edge.</p>

<p>A formation of mud dunes similar to those we
had encountered near Saigsi is here to be noticed,
this time, however, not directly in front of each
gap in the mountain range, but opposite them
near the range in front, that forms a kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-374" id="Pg_1-374"></a>[<a href="./images/1-374.png">374</a>]</span>
bay. These dunes were probably caused by the
deposit of sand and gravel left by a current that
met the barrier of mountains on the opposite
side of the bay.</p>

<p>On crossing the hill range some eighteen miles
from Kiafteh, we come across a sand-bar which
stretches in a semi-circle half way across the
valley, where it then suddenly turns south-east.
It is about 80 feet high. To all appearance the
sand deposited upon this bar seems to have
travelled in a direction from north north-east
to south south-west. A mile further it meets
another sand dune, stretching in a general
direction of south-west to north-east. Where
the higher dune comes to an end half-way
across the valley we find a village, having the
usual quadrangular mud enclosure with towers,
an abandoned caravanserai fast tumbling down,
and a few domed mud hovels. The larger and
better preserved village of Bafru, one mile to the
east of the track, is well surrounded by a long
expanse of verdant trees. South of it is the
other flourishing settlement of Deawat (Deabad).</p>

<p>The abandoned village of Assiabo Gordoneh,
now in ruins, tells us a sad story. The village at
one time evidently ran short of water. Hundreds
of borings can be seen all round it in all directions,
but they must have been of no avail. The place
had to be forsaken.</p>

<p>The sand dune is here 80 feet high. The
space between these two sand dunes&mdash;plateau-like&mdash;is
nicely cultivated in patches where some
water has been found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-375" id="Pg_1-375"></a>[<a href="./images/1-375.png">375</a>]</span></p>

<p>We arrived in the evening at Biddeh, a very
large and most weird place, with habitations
partly cut into the high mud banks. The houses
were several storeys high. The greater number
of buildings, now in ruins, show evidence of the
former importance of this place and the wonderful
ancient aqueducts with the water carried over
a high bridge from one side of a ravine to the
other are of great interest. This must have been
a prosperous place at one time. The whitish
clay soil has been quaintly corroded by the action
of water, and one finds curious grottoes and deep,
contorted, natural channels. A mosque and
several impressive buildings&mdash;the adjective only
applies when you do not get too near them&mdash;stand
high up against the cliff side. The
whole place is quite picturesque.</p>

<p>The mules go along a narrow lane between
walled fields, and then by a steepish ascent
among ruined houses and patches of cultivation
we reach the summit of the clay dune, on which
the newer village of Meiboh (Maibut)&mdash;3,940 feet&mdash;is
situated.</p>

<p>There is a most beautiful (for Persia) caravanserai
here with a delightful domed tank of clear
spring water, in which I then and there took a
delicious bath, much to the horror of the
caravanserai proprietor who assured me&mdash;when
it was too late&mdash;that the tank was no <i>hammam</i> or
bath, but was water for drinking purposes. His
horror turned into white rage when, moreover,
he declared that my soap, which I had used
freely, would kill all the fish which he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-376" id="Pg_1-376"></a>[<a href="./images/1-376.png">376</a>]</span>
carefully nursed for years in the tank. We
spent most of the evening in watching the
state of their health, and eventually it was
with some relief that we perceived all the
soap float away and the water again become
as clear as crystal. To the evident discomfiture
of the caravanserai man, when we paid the
last visit to the tank at 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> just previous
to my departure, no deaths were to be registered
in the tank, and therefore no heavy
damages to pay.</p>

<p>There is nothing one misses more than baths
while travelling in central and eastern Persia.
There is generally hardly sufficient water to
drink at the various stages, and it is usually so
slimy and bad that, although one does not mind
drinking it, because one has to, one really would
not dream of bathing or washing in it! Hence
my anxiety not to lose my chance of a good
plunge at Meiboh.</p>

<p>On leaving Meiboh at 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we passed for a
considerable distance through land under cultivation,
the crop being principally wheat. A large
flour-mill was in course of construction at
Meiboh. After that we were again travelling
on a sandy plain, with thousands of borings for
water on all sides, and were advancing mainly to
the south-west towards the mountains. We
continued thus for some twelve miles as far as
Shamsi, another large village with much cultivation
around it. After that, there were sand and
stones under our mules' hoofs, and a broiling sun
over our heads. On both sides the track was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-377" id="Pg_1-377"></a>[<a href="./images/1-377.png">377</a>]</span>
screened by mountains and by a low hill range to
the north-east.</p>

<p>About eight miles from Shamsi we entered a
region of sand hills, the sand accumulations&mdash;at
least, judging by the formation of the hills&mdash;showing
the movement of the sand to have been
from west to east. This fact was rather curious
and contrasted with nearly all the other sand
accumulations which we found later in eastern
Persia, where the sand moved mostly in a south-westerly
direction. No doubt the direction of
the wind was here greatly influenced and made to
deviate by the barriers of mountains so close at
hand.</p>

<p>There were numerous villages, large and small,
on both sides of the track. Hodjatabad, our last
halt before reaching Yezd, only sixteen miles
further, had a handsome caravanserai, the porch
of which was vaulted over the high road. It was
comparatively clean, and had spacious stabling
for animals. Delicious grapes were to be obtained
here, and much of the country had been
cleared of the sand deposit and its fertile soil
cultivated.</p>

<p>Fuel was very expensive in Persia. At the entrance
of nearly every caravanserai was displayed
a large clumsy wooden scale, upon which wood
was weighed for sale to travellers, and also, of
course, barley and fodder for one's animals. The
weights were generally round stones of various
sizes.</p>

<p>Jaffarabad, a very large and prosperous place,
stood about one mile to the north-west of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-378" id="Pg_1-378"></a>[<a href="./images/1-378.png">378</a>]</span>
caravanserai, and had vegetation and many trees
near it; this was also the case with the other
village of Medjamed, which had innumerable
fields round it.</p>

<p>Firuzabad came next as we proceeded towards
Yezd, and then, after progressing very slowly,&mdash;we
sank deep in sand for several miles&mdash;we perceived
upon a rugged hill a large round white
"tower of silence," which had been erected
there by the Guebres <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: 'or' has been moved inside the parentheses">(or</ins> Parsees) for the disposal
of their dead. We skirted the mud wall
of Elawad&mdash;where the women's dress was in
shape not unlike that of Turkish women, and
consisted of ample, highly-coloured trousers and
short zouave jacket. The men resembled Afghans.</p>

<p>I here came across the first running camel I
had seen in Persia, and on it was mounted a
picturesque rider, who had slung to his saddle a
sword, a gun, and two pistols, while round his
waistband a dagger, a powder-flask, bullet pouch,
cap carrier, and various such other warlike implements
hung gracefully in the bright light of
the sun. A few yards further we came upon a
ghastly sight&mdash;a split camel. The poor obstinate
beast had refused to cross a narrow stream by
the bridge, and had got instead on the slippery
mud near the water edge. His long clumsy
hind-legs had slipped with a sudden <i>&eacute;cart</i> that
had torn his body ripped open. The camel was
being killed as we passed, and its piercing cries
and moans were too pitiful for words.</p>

<p>The mountain on which the huge tower of
silence has been erected&mdash;by permission of Zil-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-379" id="Pg_1-379"></a>[<a href="./images/1-379.png">379</a>]</span>es-Sultan,
I was told&mdash;is quadrangular with a long,
narrow, flat-topped platform on the summit.
The best view of it is obtained from the south.
Sadek told me in all seriousness from information
received from the natives, that the bodies are
placed in these towers in a sitting position with
a stick under the chin to support them erect.
When crows come in swarms to pick away at
the body, if the right eye is plucked out first
by a plundering bird, it is said to be a sure sign
that the ex-soul of the body will go to heaven.
If the left eye is picked at first, then a warmer
climate is in store for the soul of the dead.</p>

<p>After leaving behind the Guebre tower we
come again upon thousands of borings for water,
and ancient <i>kanats</i>, now dry and unused. The
country grows less sandy about eight miles from
Yezd, and we have now gradually ascended some
320 feet from the village of Meiboh (Maibut)
to an altitude of 4,230 feet. Here we altogether
miss the flourishing cultivation which lined the
track as far as the Guebre tower, and cannot
detect a single blade of grass or natural vegetation
of any kind on any side. There are high
mountains to the south-west and east.</p>

<p>On the right (west) side of the track, eight
miles from Yezd, is the neat mud wall of Nusseratabad,
with a few trees peeping above it, but to
the left of us all is barren, and we toddled along
on grey, clayish sand.</p>

<p>Half-way between Nusseratabad and Yezd a
four-towered well is to be found, and a quarter
of a mile further the Mazereh Sadrih village,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-380" id="Pg_1-380"></a>[<a href="./images/1-380.png">380</a>]</span>
one and a-half farsakhs from Yezd. The mules
sank deep in the fine sand. There were a good
many Guebres about, mostly employed in carrying
manure on donkeys. One of them, who was
just returning from one of these errands, addressed
me, much to my surprise, in Hindustani, which
he spoke quite fluently. He told me that he
had travelled all over India, and was about to
start again for Bombay.</p>

<p>Some "<i>badjir</i>"&mdash;high ventilating shafts&mdash;and
a minaret or two tell us that we are approaching
the town of Yezd&mdash;the ancient city of the Parsees&mdash;and
soon after we enter the large suburb
of Mardavoh, with its dome and graceful tower.</p>

<p>A track in an almost direct line, and shorter
than the one I had followed, exists between
Isfahan and Yezd. It passes south of the

Isfahan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yezd</span> is the most central city of Persia, but
from a pictorial point of view the least interesting
city in the Shah's empire. There are a great
many mosques&mdash;it is said about fifty&mdash;but none
very beautiful. The streets are narrow and
tortuous, with high walls on either side and
nothing particularly attractive about them.
Curious narrow arches are frequently to be
noticed overhead in the streets, and it is supposed
that they are to support the side walls
against collapse.</p>

<p>There is not, at least I could not find, a single
building of note in the city except the principal
and very ancient mosque,&mdash;a building in the last
degree of decay, but which must have formerly
been adorned with a handsome frontage. There
is a very extensive but tumbling-down wall
around the city, and a wide moat, reminding
one of a once strongly fortified place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-382" id="Pg_1-382"></a>[<a href="./images/1-382.png">382</a>]</span></p>

<p>To-day the greater portion of Yezd is in ruins.
The water supply is unfortunately very defective
and irregular. There are no perennial streams of
any importance, and all the irrigation works are
dependent on artificial subterranean canals and
kanats, and these in their turn are mostly subject
to the rain and snow fall on the hills surrounding
Yezd. Unluckily, the rains are now neither
frequent nor abundant, and the land has in consequence
been suffering severely from want of
water. Snow falls in winter and to a great
extent feeds the whole water supply of Yezd and
its neighbourhood. It is not surprising, therefore,
that more than three-quarters of the province of
Yezd is barren land, cultivation being under the
circumstances absolutely out of the question.
Some portions of the province, however, where
water is obtainable are quite fertile.</p>

<p>Towards the west the hills show some signs of
vegetation, mainly fruit trees. But nothing
larger than a bush grows wild, if we except
occasional stunted fig-trees. Surrounded by
mountains as Yezd is, there are two different
climates close at hand: that of the "Kohestan"
or hills, temperate in summer but piercing cold
in winter, and the other, much warmer, of the
low-lying land. In the eastern lowlands the
summer heat is excessive, in autumn just bearable,
and in the spring the climate is quite
delightful. In all seasons, however, with few
exceptions, it is generally dry and always healthy
and pure.</p>

<p>Where some moisture is obtainable the soil is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-383" id="Pg_1-383"></a>[<a href="./images/1-383.png">383</a>]</span>
very fertile and is cultivated by the natives. The
chief cultivated products are wheat, barley, and
other cereals, cotton, opium, and tobacco. The
vine flourishes near Yezd, and the wines used by
the Parsees are not unpalatable. Mulberries are
cultivated in large quantities. Silk is probably
the most important product of the Yezd district.
Wild game is said to be plentiful on the mountains.
With the exception of salt, the mineral
products of the district are insignificant.</p>

<p>Yezd is a great trading centre, partly owing
to its geographical position, partly because its
inhabitants are very go-ahead and enterprising.
Yezd men are great travellers and possess good
business heads. They go across the salt desert
to Khorassan and Afghanistan, and they trade,
with India principally, via Kerman, Bandar
Abbas, and Lingah, and also to a small extent
via Sistan. Previously the trade went entirely
by Shiraz and Bushire, but now that road is
very unsafe, owing to robbers. Yezd traders
travel even much further afield, as far as China,
India, Java. During my short stay I met quite
a number of people who had visited Bombay,
Calcutta, Russia, Bokhara, and Turkestan.</p>

<p>The settled population of Yezd consists mostly
of Shia Mahommedans, the descendants of the
ancient Persian race, with an intermixture of
foreign blood; the Parsees or Zoroastrians, who
still retain their purity of race and religious
faith, and who are principally engaged in agriculture
and commerce; a very small community
of European Christians, including a few Armenian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-384" id="Pg_1-384"></a>[<a href="./images/1-384.png">384</a>]</span>
natives of Julfa (Isfahan). Then there are about
one thousand Jews, who live mostly in abject
poverty.</p>

<p>The Mahommedan population of the town
may be approximately estimated at sixty thousand.
Here, even more noticeably than in any
other Persian town, there is very little outward
show in the buildings, which are of earth and
mud and appear contemptible, but the interiors
of houses of the rich are pleasant and well-cared
for. The miserable look of the town, however,
is greatly redeemed by the beauty of the gardens
which surround it.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the roads in and
around Yezd are in a wretched condition, being
absolutely neglected, for were there safer and
more practicable roads trade would be facilitated
and encouraged to no mean degree. As things
stand now, indigenous trade is increasing slowly,
but foreign trade is making no headway. The
silk and opium trades, which were formerly the
most profitable, have of late declined. Cottons
and woollens, silk, the <i>Kasb</i> and <i>Aluhi</i> of very
finest quality, shawls, cotton carpets and noted
felts equal if not superior to the best of Kum,
are manufactured both for home use and for
export.</p>

<p>The exports mainly consist of almonds and
nuts, tobacco, opium (to China), colouring
matters, walnut-wood, silk, wool, cotton carpets,
felts, skins, assafoetida, shoes, copper pots,
country loaf-sugar, sweetmeats, for which Yezd
is celebrated, etc. Henna is brought to Yezd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-385" id="Pg_1-385"></a>[<a href="./images/1-385.png">385</a>]</span>
from Minab and Bandar Abbas to be ground and
prepared for the Persian market, being used with
<i>rang</i> as a dye for the hair.</p>

<p>The chief imports are spices, cotton goods,
yarn, prints, copper sheeting, tin slabs, Indian
tea, broadcloth, jewellery, arms, cutlery, watches,
earthenware, glass and enamel wares, iron, loaf-sugar,
powdered sugar, etc.</p>

<p>The Government of Yezd, as of other cities
of Persia, is purely despotic, limited only by the
power and influence of the Mahommedan priests,
the Mullahs, and by the dread of private vengeance
or an occasional insurrection. It is true
that the actions of Hakims and Governors and
their deputies are liable to revision from the
Teheran authorities, but this does not prevent
exactions and extortions being carried on quite
openly and on a large scale.</p>

<p>The present Governor, Salal-ud-dauleh&mdash;"Glory
of the state,"&mdash;eldest son of Zil-es-Sultan,
is an intelligent and well-to-do young
man, sensibly educated, who tries his best to
be fair to everybody; but it is very difficult for
him to run alone against the strong tide of
corruption which swamps everything in Persia.
He is not in good health, and spends much of
his time hunting wild game at his country place
in the hills near Yezd. His town residence is a
kind of citadel&mdash;not particularly impressive, nor
clean&mdash;inside the city wall. The Naib-ul-Kukumat
was the Deputy-Governor at the time
of my visit. He seemed quite an affable and
intelligent man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-386" id="Pg_1-386"></a>[<a href="./images/1-386.png">386</a>]</span></p>

<p>Near the Palace in the heart of the city are
the covered bazaars, old and new, and well
stocked with goods, but they are in character so
exactly like those of Teheran and Isfahan,
already described in previous chapters, that a
repetition is quite unnecessary. The streets are
irregularly planned, and the older ones are very
dark and dingy, but the newer arcades are lofty
and handsome. The merchants seem&mdash;for Persia&mdash;quite
active and business-like.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century
the population of Yezd is said to have been one
hundred thousand souls, and to have dwindled
down to less than thirty thousand in 1868-1870
during the terrific famine which took place at
that time. Whether this is correct or not, it is
difficult to ascertain, but to-day the city is on
the increase again, and the population, as already
stated, is certainly not less than sixty thousand.
There are numerous Mahommedan <i>hammams</i>
(baths)&mdash;some 65 or more&mdash;in Yezd, but Europeans
are not allowed to enter them.</p>

<p>The Yezd people are very forward in educational
matters. I inspected some of the schools
and colleges, and was much impressed by the
matter-of-fact, sensible way in which some of
the more modern institutions were conducted.
They would indeed put to shame a great many
of our schools in England, and as for the talent
of children, as compared with English children
of the same age, one had better say nothing at
all. With no exaggeration, children aged six
analysed and reasoned out problems placed before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-387" id="Pg_1-387"></a>[<a href="./images/1-387.png">387</a>]</span>
them in a way that would in this country
baffle men of six times that age. The quickness
of the Persian child's brain is well-nigh astounding,
and as for their goodness and diligence,
there is only one word that fits them: they are
simply "angelic." Their intense reverence for
the teachers, their eagerness really to learn, and
their quiet, attentive behaviour were indeed
worthy of admiration. But it must be well
understood that these angelic traits are confined
to the school-days only. When they leave
school the "angelic" wears off very soon, and
the boys, unluckily, drift into the old and demoralized
ways with which Persia is reeking.</p>

<p>There are about a dozen public schools in
Yezd, but the one conducted on most modern
lines is the new school started by the Mushir.
If I understood aright, the Mushir provided the
buildings and money to work the school for a
period of time, after which if successful it will
be handed over to be supported by the city or by
private enterprise.</p>

<p>The school was excellent. There were a
hundred pupils from the ages of six to fifteen,
and they were taught Arabic, Persian, English,
French, geography, arithmetic, &amp;c. There was
a Mudir or head master who spoke French quite
fluently, and separate teachers for the other various
matters. The school was admirably conducted,
with quite a military discipline mingled
with extreme kindness and thoughtfulness on the
part of the teachers towards the pupils. By the
sound of a bell the boys were collected by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-388" id="Pg_1-388"></a>[<a href="./images/1-388.png">388</a>]</span>
Mudir in the court-yard, round which on two
floors were the schoolrooms, specklessly clean
and well-aired.</p>

<p>While I was being entertained to tea, sherbet,
and coffee, on a high platform, I was politely
requested to ascertain for myself the knowledge
of the boys&mdash;most of whom had only been in the
school less than a year. It was rather interesting
to hear little chaps of six or eight rattle off,
in a language foreign to them and without
making a single mistake, all the capitals of the
principal countries in the world, and the largest
rivers, the highest mountains, the biggest oceans,
and so on. And other little chaps&mdash;no taller
than three feet&mdash;summed up and subtracted and
divided and multiplied figures with an assurance,
quickness and accuracy which I, personally, very
much envied. Then they wrote English and
French sentences on the slate, and Persian and
Arabic, and I came out of the school fully convinced
that whatever was taught in that school
was certainly taught well. These were not
special pupils, but any pupil I chose to pick
out from the lot.</p>

<p>I visited another excellent institution, the
Parsee school&mdash;one of several teaching institutions
that have been established in Yezd by the
Bombay Society for the amelioration of Persian
Zoroastrians,&mdash;in a most beautiful building internally,
with large courts and a lofty vaulted
hall wherein the classes are held. The boys,
from the ages of six to fifteen, lined the walls,
sitting cross-legged on mats, their notebooks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-389" id="Pg_1-389"></a>[<a href="./images/1-389.png">389</a>]</span>
inkstands, and slate by their side. At the time
of my visit there were as many as 230 pupils,
and they received a similar education, but not
quite so high, as in the Mushir school. In the
Parsee school less time was devoted to foreign
languages.</p>

<p>Ustad Javan Mard, a most venerable old man,
was the head-master, and Ustad Baharam his
assistant. The school seemed most flourishing,
and the pupils very well-behaved. Although
the stocks for punishing bad children were very
prominent under the teacher's table, the head-master
assured me that they were seldom required.</p>

<p>Another little but most interesting school is
the one in connection with the clerical work
done by the Rev. Napier Malcolm. It is attended
principally by the sons of well-to-do
Mussulmans and by a few Parsees, who take
this excellent opportunity of learning English
thoroughly. Most of the teaching is done by
an Armenian assistant trained at the C. M. S. of
Julfa. Here, too, I was delightfully surprised to
notice how intelligent the boys were, and Mr.
Malcolm himself spoke in high terms of the
work done by the students. They showed a
great facility for learning languages, and I
was shown a boy who, in a few months, had
picked up sufficient English to converse quite
fluently. The boys, I was glad to see, are
taught in a very sensible manner, and what
they are made to learn will be of permanent use
to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-390" id="Pg_1-390"></a>[<a href="./images/1-390.png">390</a>]</span></p>

<p>The Church Missionary Society is to be thanked,
not only for this good educational work which it
supplies in Yezd to children of all creeds, but for
the well-appointed hospital for men and women.
A large and handsome caravanserai was presented
to the Medical Mission by Mr. Godarz Mihri-ban-i-Irani,
one of the leading Parsees of Yezd,
and the building was adapted and converted by
the Church Missionary Society into a hospital,
with a permanent staff in the men's hospital of
an English doctor and three Armenian assistants.
There is also a smaller women's hospital
with an English lady doctor, who in 1901 was
aided by two ladies and by an Armenian assistant
trained at Julfa.</p>

<p>There are properly disinfected wards in both
these hospitals, with good beds, a well appointed
dispensary, and dissecting room.</p>

<p>The natives have of late availed themselves
considerably of the opportunity to get good
medical assistance, but few except the very
poorest, it seems, care actually to remain in the
hospital wards. They prefer to take the medicine
and go to their respective houses. A special
dark room has been constructed for the operation
and cure of cataract, which is a common complaint
in Yezd.</p>

<p>The health of Yezd is uncommonly good, and
were it not that the people ruin their digestive
organs by excessive and injudicious eating, the
ailments of Yezd would be very few. The
population is, without exception, most favourable
to the work of the Medical Mission, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-391" id="Pg_1-391"></a>[<a href="./images/1-391.png">391</a>]</span>
classes seem to be grateful for the institution in
the town.</p>

<p>The school work of the Mission necessarily
appeals to a much smaller circle, but there is no
doubt whatever about its being appreciated, and,
further, there seems to be exceedingly little
hostility to such religious inquiry and teaching
as does not altogether collide with or appear to
tend to severance from the Mussulman or Parsee
communities. This is very likely due to the
fast extending influence of the Behai sect, the
members of which regard favourably an acquaintance
with other non-idolatrous religions.
These people, notwithstanding their being outside
of official protection and in collision with
the Mullahs, form to-day a large proportion of
the population of Yezd, and exercise an influence
on public opinion considerably wider than the
boundaries of their sect. As for actual Missionary
work of Christianization going beyond this
point, the difficulties encountered and the risks
of a catastrophe are too great at present for any
sensible man to attempt it.</p>

<p>The European staff of the C.M.S. Mission,
employed entirely in educational and medical
work in Yezd, consists of the Rev. Napier
Malcolm, M.A., a most sensible and able man,
and Mrs. Malcolm, who is of great help to her
husband; George Day Esq., L.R.C.P. &amp; S., and
Mrs. Day; Miss Taylor, L.R.C.P. &amp; S., Miss
Stirling, Miss Brighty.</p>

<p>The work for ladies is somewhat uphill and
not always pleasant, for in Mussulman countries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-392" id="Pg_1-392"></a>[<a href="./images/1-392.png">392</a>]</span>
women, if not veiled, are constantly exposed to
the insults of roughs; but people are beginning
to get reconciled to what appeared to them at
first the very strange habits of European women,
and no doubt in time it will be less unpleasant
for ladies to work among the natives. So far
the few English ladies who have braved the
consequences of undertaking work in Persia are
greatly to be admired for their pluck, patience,
and tact.</p>

<p>The Yezd C.M.S. Mission was started in
May, 1898, by Dr. Henry White, who had a
year's previous experience of medical work at
Julfa and Isfahan. He was then joined in
December of the same year by the Rev. Napier
Malcolm, who had just come out from England.
The European community of Yezd is very small.
Besides the above mentioned people&mdash;who do
not always reside in Yezd&mdash;there are two
Englishmen of the Bank of Persia, and a Swiss
employed by the firm of Ziegler &amp; Co. That
is all.</p>

<p>The fact that the Persian Government recognizes
the "race religions," such as those of
Armenians, Parsees and Jews, has led many to
believe that religious liberty exists in Persia.
There is a relative tolerance, but nothing more,
and even the Parsees and Jews have had until
quite lately&mdash;and occasionally even now have&mdash;to
submit to considerable indignities on the part
of the Mullahs. For new sects like the Behai,
however, who abandon the Mussulman faith,
there is absolutely no official protection. Great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-393" id="Pg_1-393"></a>[<a href="./images/1-393.png">393</a>]</span>
secrecy has to be maintained to avoid persecution.
There seems, nevertheless, to be a disposition on
the part of the Government to go considerably
beyond this point of sufferance, but wider
toleration does not exist at present, nor is it
perfectly clear to what length the Government
of the country would be prepared to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yezd</span> is extremely interesting from a historical
point of view, and for its close association with
that wonderful race the "Guebres," better known
in Europe by the name of Parsees. The ancient
city of Askizar was buried by shifting sands, in a
desert with a few oases, and was followed by the
present Yezd, which does not date from earlier
than the time of the Sassanian dynasty.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-49.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-49_th.jpg" alt="Ardeshir Meheban Irani and the Leading Members of the Anguman-i-Nasseri (Parsee National Assembly), Yezd." title="Ardeshir Meheban Irani and the Leading Members of the Anguman-i-Nasseri (Parsee National Assembly), Yezd." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Ardeshir Meheban Irani and the Leading Members of the Anguman-i-Nasseri (Parsee National Assembly), Yezd.</p>

<p>Yezdeyard, the weak and unlucky last King of
the Sassan family, which had reigned over Persia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-395" id="Pg_1-395"></a>[<a href="./images/1-395.png">395</a>]</span>
for 415 years, was the first to lay the foundations
of the city and to colonize its neighbourhood.
It is in this city that, notwithstanding the sufferings
and persecution of Mussulmans after the
Arab invasion of Persia, the successors of a handful
of brave people have to this day remained
faithful to their native soil.</p>

<p>To be convinced that the Parsees of Yezd are
a strikingly fine lot of people it is sufficient to
look at them. The men are patriarchal, generous,
sober, intelligent, thrifty; the women, contrary
to the usage of all Asiatic races, are given great
freedom, but are renowned for their chastity and
modesty.</p>

<p>The name of Parsees, adopted by the better-known
Guebres who migrated to India, has been
retained from Fars or Pars, their native country,
which contained, before the Arab invasion,
Persepolis as the capital, with a magnificent
royal palace. From this province the whole
kingdom eventually adopted the name.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go into the history of
the nine dynasties which ruled in Persia before
it was conquered by the Arabs, but for our purpose
it is well to remind the reader that of all
these dynasties the Sassanian was the last, and
Yezdeyard, as we have seen, the ultimate King
of the Sassan family.</p>

<p>One is filled with horror at the romantic tale
of how, through weakness on his part and
treachery on that of his people, the fanatic
Arabs, guided by the light of Allah the Prophet,
conquered Persia, slaying the unbelievers and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-396" id="Pg_1-396"></a>[<a href="./images/1-396.png">396</a>]</span>
enforcing the Mahommedan religion on the
survivors. The runaway Yezdeyard was treacherously
slain with his own jewelled sword
by a miller, in whose house he had obtained
shelter after the disastrous battle of Nahavand
and his flight through Sistan, Khorassan and
Merv. Persia, with every vestige of its magnificence,
was lost for ever to the Persians, and the
supremacy of Mahommedanism, with its demoralizing
influence, its haughty intolerance and
fanatic bigotism, was firmly established from one
end of the country to the other. The fine temples,
the shrines of the Zoroastrians, were mercilessly
destroyed or changed into mosques.</p>

<p>Zoroaster, the prophet of the Parsees, had first
promulgated his religion during the reign of
Gushtasp (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1300) of the Kayanian family,
but after centuries of vicissitudes and corruption
it was not till the time of the Sassanian dynasty
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 226) that Ardeshir Babekhan, the brave
and just, restored the Zoroastrian religion to its
ancient purity. It is this religion&mdash;the true
religion of ancient Persia&mdash;that was smothered
by the conquered Arabs by means of blood and
steel, and is only to-day retained in a slightly
modified character by the few remaining Guebres
of Yezd and Kerman, as well as by those who,
sooner than sacrifice their religious convictions
and their independence, preferred to abandon
their native land, migrating to India with their
families, where their successors are to be found
to this day still conservative to their faith.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that, although&mdash;in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-397" id="Pg_1-397"></a>[<a href="./images/1-397.png">397</a>]</span>
the conglomeration of races that form the Indian
Empire&mdash;the Parsees are few in number, not
more than 100,000 all counted, they nevertheless
occupy, through their honesty, intelligence and
firmness of character, the foremost place in that
country. But with these Parsees who migrated
we have no space to deal here. We will
merely see why the remainder escaped death at
the hands of the Mahommedans, and, while ever remaining
true to their religion, continued in Yezd
and Kerman when, under the new rulers, almost
the whole of the Zoroastrian population of Persia
was compelled to embrace the religion of Islam.</p>

<p>The fact that Yezd and Kerman were two distant
and difficult places of access for the invading
Moslems, may be taken as the likely cause of
the Zoroastrians collecting there. Also for the
same reason, no doubt, the Arabs, tired of fighting
and slaying, and having given way to luxury and
vice, had become too lazy to carry on their
wholesale slaughter of the Zoroastrian population.
This leniency, however, has not done away entirely
with constant tyrannical persecution and
oppression of the unbelievers, so that now the
number of Zoroastrians of Yezd does not exceed
7,000, and that of Kerman is under 3,000. A great
many Zoroastrians have, notwithstanding their
unwillingness, been since compelled to turn Mahommedans.
Even fifty years ago the Zoroastrians
of Yezd and Kerman called in Persia
contemptuously "Guebres," were subjected to
degradations and restrictions of the worst kind.
Now their condition, under a stronger govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-398" id="Pg_1-398"></a>[<a href="./images/1-398.png">398</a>]</span>ment
and some foreign influence, has slightly
ameliorated, but is not yet entirely secure against
the cruelty, fanaticism, and injustice of the Mullahs
and officials in the place.</p>

<p>If Yezd is, for its size, now the most enterprising
trading centre of Persia, it is mostly due
to the Guebres living there. Although held in
contempt by the Mullahs and by the Mahommedans
in general, these Guebres are manly
fellows, sound in body and brain, instead of lascivious,
demoralized, effeminate creatures like their
tyrants. Hundreds of years of oppression have
had little effect on the moral and physical condition
of the Guebres. They are still as hardy
and proud as when the whole country belonged
to them; nor has the demoralizing contact of
the present race, to whom they are subject, had
any marked effect on their industry, which was
the most remarkable characteristic in the ancient
Zoroastrians.</p>

<p>The Zoroastrian religion teaches that every
man must earn his food by his own exertion
and enterprise,&mdash;quite unlike the Mahommedan
teaching, that the height of bliss is to live on the
charity of one's neighbours, which rule, however,
carries a counterbalancing conviction that the
more money dispensed in alms, the greater the
certainty of the givers obtaining after death a
seat in heaven.</p>

<p>One of the most refreshing qualities of the
Guebres (and of the Parsees in India) is that they
are usually extraordinarily truthful for natives of
Asia, and their morality, even in men, is indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-399" id="Pg_1-399"></a>[<a href="./images/1-399.png">399</a>]</span>
quite above the average. There are few races
among which marriages are conducted on more
sensible lines and are more successful. The man
and woman united by marriage live in friendly
equality, and are a help to one another. Family
ties are very strong, and are carried down even
to distant relations, while the paternal and maternal
love for their children, and touching filial
love for their parents, is most praiseworthy and
deserves the greatest admiration.</p>

<p>The Mussulmans themselves, although religiously
at variance and not keen to follow the
good example of the Guebres, admit the fact
that the Zoroastrians are honest and good people.
It is principally the Mullahs who are bitter
against them and instigate the crowds to excesses.
There is not such a thing for the Guebres as
justice in Persia, and even up to quite recent
times their fire temples and towers of silence
were attacked and broken into by Mussulman
crowds, the fires, so tenderly cared for, mercilessly
put out: the sacred books destroyed, and the
temples desecrated in the most insulting manner.</p>

<p>There are a number of Guebre places of worship
in Yezd, and in the surrounding villages
inhabited by Guebre agriculturists, but the principal
one is in the centre of the Guebre quarter
of Yezd city. It is a neat, small structure,
very simple and whitewashed inside, with a
fortified back room wherein the sacred fire is
kept alight, well covered with ashes by a specially
deputed priest. It is hidden so as to make it
difficult for intending invaders to discover it; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-400" id="Pg_1-400"></a>[<a href="./images/1-400.png">400</a>]</span>
the strong door, well protected by iron bars,
wants a good deal of forcing before it can be
knocked down.</p>

<p>The religious ceremony in the temple of the
Guebres is very interesting, the officiating priests
being dressed up in a long white garment, the
<i>sudra</i>, held together by a sacred girdle, and with
the lower portion of the face covered by a square
piece of cloth like a handkerchief; on the head
they wear a peculiar cap. Various genuflexions,
on a specially spread carpet, and bows are made
and prayers read.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-50.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-50_th.jpg" alt="Parsee Priests of Yezd Officiating during Ceremony in their Fire Temple." title="Parsee Priests of Yezd Officiating during Ceremony in their Fire Temple." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Parsee Priests of Yezd Officiating during Ceremony in their Fire Temple.</p>

<p>The priests belong generally to the better
classes, and the rank is mostly hereditary. Certain
ceremonies are considered necessary before the
candidate can attain the actual dignity of a prelate.
First of the ceremonies comes the <i>navar</i>,
or six days' retreat in his own dwelling, followed
by the ceremony of initiation; four more days
in the fire temple with two priests who have
previously gone through the <i>Yasna</i> prayers for
six consecutive mornings. Although after this
he can officiate in some ceremonies, such as
weddings, he is not fully qualified as a priest
until the <i>Bareshnun</i> has been undergone and
again the <i>Yasna</i>. The following day other
prayers are offered to the guardian spirit, and
at midnight the last ceremony takes place, and
he is qualified to the degree of <i>Maratab</i>, when
he can take part in any of the Zoroastrian rituals.</p>

<p>As a preliminary, great purity of mind and
body are required from candidates, and they are
made to endure lavish ablutions of water and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-401" id="Pg_1-401"></a>[<a href="./images/1-401.png">401</a>]</span>
cow urine, clay and sand&mdash;an ancient custom,
said to cleanse the body better than modern
soaps. After that the candidate is secluded for
nine whole days in the fire temple, and is not
permitted to touch human beings, vegetation,
water nor fire, and must wash himself twice
more during that time, on the fourth day and on
the seventh. It is only then that he is considered
amply purified and able to go through the <i>Navar</i>
ceremony.</p>

<p>The Zoroastrian religion is based on three
excellent points&mdash;"good thoughts, good words,
good deeds"&mdash;and as long as people adhere to
them it is difficult to see how they can go
wrong. They worship God and only one God,
and do not admit idolatry. They are most
open-minded regarding other people's notions,
and are ever ready to recognise that other
religions have their own good points.</p>

<p>Perhaps no greater libel was ever perpetrated
on the Parsees than when they were put down
as "fire-worshippers," or "worshippers of the
elements." The Parsees are God-worshippers,
but revere, not worship, fire and the sun as symbols
of glory, heat, splendour, and purity; also
because fire is to human beings one of the most
necessary things in creation, if not indeed the
most necessary thing; otherwise they are no
more fire-worshippers than the Roman Catholics,
for instance, who might easily come under the
same heading, for they have lighted candles and
lights constantly burning in front of images
inside their churches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-402" id="Pg_1-402"></a>[<a href="./images/1-402.png">402</a>]</span></p>

<p>Besides, it is not the fire itself, as fire, that
Parsees nurse in their temples, but a fire specially
purified for the purpose. The process is this:
Several fires, if possible originally lighted by
some natural cause, such as lightning, are
brought in vases. Over one of these fires is
placed a flat perforated tray of metal on which
small pieces of very dry sandal-wood are made
to ignite by the mere action of the heat, but
must not actually come in contact with the
flame below. From this fire a third one is
lighted in a similar manner, and nine times this
operation is repeated, each successive fire being
considered purer than its predecessor, and the
result of the ninth conflagration being pronounced
absolutely pure.</p>

<p>It is really the idea of the purifying process
that the Parsees revere more than the fire itself,
and as the ninth fire alone is considered worthy
to occupy a special place in their temples, so, in
similarity to it, they aim in life to purify their
own thoughts, words, and actions, and glorify
them into "good thoughts, true words, noble
actions." This is indeed very different from fire-worshipping
of which the Parsees are generally
accused.</p>

<p>In Yezd the Guebres told me that they
possessed very few sacred books in their temple
(or if they had them could not show them).
They said that all the ancient books had been
destroyed by the Mahommedans or had been
taken away to India.</p>

<p>There were also several smaller temples in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-403" id="Pg_1-403"></a>[<a href="./images/1-403.png">403</a>]</span>
neighbourhood of Yezd, which had gone through
a good many vicissitudes in their time, but now
the Parsees and their places of worship are left
in comparative peace. Parsee men and women
are still compelled to wear special clothes so as
to be detected at once in the streets, but this
custom is gradually dying out. The women are
garbed in highly-coloured striped garments, a
short jacket and a small turban, leaving the face
uncovered. The men are only allowed to wear
certain specially-coloured cloaks and are not
allowed to ride a horse in the streets of Yezd.</p>

<p>Parsees do not enjoy the civil rights of other
citizens in Persia, and justice was until quite
lately out of the question in the case of differences
with Mussulmans. At death a man's property
would be lawfully inherited by any distant
relation who had adopted the religion of Moslem,
instead of by the man's own children and wife
who had remained faithful to their creed; and
in the matter of recovering debts from Mussulmans
the law of Persia is certainly very far
indeed from helping a Guebre. This is necessarily
a great obstacle in commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>Worst of all the burdens formerly inflicted
upon the Guebres&mdash;as well as upon Armenians
and Jews of Persia&mdash;was the "jazia" tax. Some
thousand or so male Guebres of Yezd were
ordered to pay the tax yearly, which with
commissions and "squeezes" of Governors and
officials was made to amount to some two
thousand tomans, or about &pound;400 at the present
rate of exchange. Much severity and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-404" id="Pg_1-404"></a>[<a href="./images/1-404.png">404</a>]</span>
cruelty were enforced to obtain payment of the
tax.</p>

<p>The Parsees were, until quite lately, debarred
from undertaking any occupation that might
place them on a level with Mahommedans.
With the exception of a few merchants&mdash;who,
by migrating to India and obtaining British
nationality, returned and enjoyed a certain
amount of nominal safety&mdash;the majority of the
population consists of agriculturists and
scavengers.</p>

<p>Mainly by the efforts of the Bombay Amelioration
Society of the Parsees, the Guebres of Yezd
and Kerman fare to-day comparatively well.
The "jazia" has been abolished, and the present
Shah and the local Government have to be congratulated
on their fairness and consideration
towards these fine people. May-be that soon
they will be permitted to enjoy all the rights of
other citizens, which they indeed fully deserve.
Many steps have been made in that direction
within the last few years. The Parsees are a
most progressive race if properly protected.
They are only too anxious to lead the way in all
reformation, and, with all this, are remarkable for
their courteousness and refined manner.</p>

<p>The most prominent members of the Yezd
community, especially the sons of Meheban
Rustam, have been the pioneers of trade between
Yezd and India. Besides the excellent Parsee
school, several other institutions have been established
in Yezd and its suburbs by the Bombay
Society, supported by a few charitable Parsees of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-405" id="Pg_1-405"></a>[<a href="./images/1-405.png">405</a>]</span>
Bombay and some of the leading members of the
Parsee community in Yezd. The Bombay Society
has done much to raise the Zoroastrians of Persia
to their present comparatively advanced state, but
trade and commerce also have to a great extent
contributed to their present eminence.</p>

<p>The Bombay Society nominates and sends an
agent to reside in Teheran, the capital of Persia,
to look after the interests of helpless Zoroastrians,
and the Parsees of Yezd have moreover a national
assembly called the Anguman-i-Nasseri.</p>

<p>I was entertained by this interesting body of
men, and received from their president, Ardeshir
Meheban Irani, much of the valuable information
here given about the Yezd Parsees. The Association
has an elected body of twenty-eight
members, all honorary, the most venerable and
intelligent of the community, and its aims are to
advocate the social rights of the Zoroastrians as a
race, to settle disputes arising between the individuals
of the community, to defend helpless
Parsees against Moslem wantonness, and to improve
their condition generally.</p>

<p>The Association was established on the 3rd of
February, 1902, by the late Mr. Kaikosroo
Firendaz Irani, the then agent of the Bombay
Society. In this work he had the advice and
help of the leading men of the community.</p>

<p>There are several naturalised British subjects
in Yezd, including the President of the Association&mdash;who
speaks and writes English as well as
any Englishman&mdash;but it is greatly to be regretted
that these men cannot obtain proper protection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-406" id="Pg_1-406"></a>[<a href="./images/1-406.png">406</a>]</span>
from the British Government. Yet these fellows
could be of very great assistance to England in
spreading British influence in Yezd, not to speak
of increasing British trade&mdash;which they are only
too anxious to do, if a chance is given them&mdash;in
conjunction with the representatives of their race
in Bombay&mdash;the most Anglicised, except in
religion, of all our subject races of India. There
was formerly a British Vice-Consul in Yezd, but
for some reason known to the Government, while
Russia finds it expedient to establish Consular
agents in all the principal centres of Persia, we
have actually withdrawn our representative even
from so important a city as Yezd!</p>

<p>The Parsee communities of Yezd and Bombay
are in constant communication with each other,
and it is well known what marvellous prosperity
these fugitives of Fars have now attained in
Bombay, through their honesty and hard work,
especially since their connection with the British,
whose civilisation, with the exception of religion
and the hat, they have entirely adopted. Most
of them speak perfect English, and many of the
sons of the wealthier Parsees have been educated
at universities in England. We find them working
banking houses on a large scale, and cotton
mills, running lines of steamers and shipbuilding
yards. They trade considerably with the Far East
and Far West, and with every nook in Asia. Even
as far as Samarkand, Bokhara, Siberia, Nijni-Novgorod,
and St. Petersburg, Parsee traders are
to be found, and in Japan, China, the United States,
and Canada. With England they carry on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-407" id="Pg_1-407"></a>[<a href="./images/1-407.png">407</a>]</span>
very extensive trade, and through them as intermediaries
much of the import trade into India
finds its way into neighbouring markets more
difficult of access to the direct British exporter.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable traits of the
flourishing Parsees of Bombay is their extreme
generosity, often hampered by petty, stupid,
Anglo-Indian officialdom, which they seem to
stand with amazing patience and good-nature.
We find well appointed hospitals erected by
them; schools, clubs, and only lately one of
the richest of all Parsees, Mr. Jamsetsji Tata, has
given the city of Bombay no less a gift than a
quarter of a million pounds for the erection of a
university on the most modern lines in that
city.</p>

inside the houses and protect the inhabitants
from the suffocating lack of ventilation during
the stifling heat of the summer. The <i>badjirs</i>
are certainly constructed in a most scientific
or, rather, practical manner, and answer the purpose
to perfection.</p>

<p>When we leave Yezd the city itself cannot be
seen at all, but just above the sand of the desert
rise hundreds of these quadrangular towers, some
very large indeed, which give the place a quaint
appearance.</p>

<p>From Yezd to Kerman there is again a service
of post-horses, so I availed myself of it in order
to save as much time as possible. The horses
were not much used on this road so they were
excellent.</p>

<p>I departed from Yezd on October 26th, and
soon after leaving the city and riding through
the usual plentiful but most unattractive ruins,
we were travelling over very uninteresting
country, practically a desert. We passed two
villages&mdash;Najafabat and Rachmatabad&mdash;and then
wound our way through avenues of dried-up
mulberry trees at Mahommedabad or Namadawat,
a village where silk-worms are reared in
quantities, which accounts for the extensive
mulberry plantations to provide food for them.
The village is large and is three farsakhs from
Yezd, or something like ten miles.</p>

<p>The "farsakh"&mdash;the most elastic measure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-410" id="Pg_1-410"></a>[<a href="./images/1-410.png">410</a>]</span>
ever invented&mdash;decreases here to just above three
miles, whereas further north it averaged four
miles.</p>

<p>In a strong wind we rode on, first on sand,
then on gravelly soil, ever through dreary,
desolate country. The villages, Taghiabad,
Zehnawat, etc., get smaller and poorer and
further apart, and some eight farsakhs from
Yezd we eventually reach the small town of Sar-i-Yezd.
From Namadawat the country was an
absolutely flat gravel plain with no water.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-51.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-51_th.jpg" alt="Interior of Old Caravanserai with Central Water Tank." title="Interior of Old Caravanserai with Central Water Tank." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Interior of Old Caravanserai with Central Water Tank.</p>

<p>At Sar-i-Yezd (altitude 4,980 feet) we were
detained some time. The highest official in the
place had received orders from the Governor of
Yezd not to let me proceed without a strong
guard to accompany me. This was rather a
nuisance than otherwise, for, although the
country between Sar-i-Yezd and Anar was
reported infested by robbers, we really should
have been able to hold our own against them
even without the rabble that was sent to accompany
us.</p>

<p>After a delay of some hours five soldiers&mdash;as
picturesque as they would have been useless in
case of danger&mdash;put in an appearance. They had
old long muzzle loaders, which must have been
more dangerous to the person firing them than
to the ones fired at, and they wore elaborate
leather belts with two ample pouches for lead
bullets, two gunpowder flasks made of desiccated
sheep testicles, a leather bag for small shot, and
a large iron ring with small clips for caps.
Horses could not be procured for these men, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-411" id="Pg_1-411"></a>[<a href="./images/1-411.png">411</a>]</span>
they had to follow my baggage on foot, which
caused a further delay.</p>

<p>We left shortly before sunset as I intended
marching the whole night. There was a great
discussion among these soldiers about crossing
over into Kerman territory, four farsakhs beyond
Sar-i-Yezd, and just at the point where the
robbers are supposed to attack caravans the
guard, whether through fear or otherwise, declined
to come on. Sadek remonstrated most
bitterly, but three of them left us, while two
said they had been entrusted with orders to see
me and my luggage safely to the place where
another guard could be obtained and would continue.
I tried to persuade them to go back too,
but they would not.</p>

<p>It appears that between Sar-i-Yezd and Zen-u-din
there is an expanse of waste land near the
boundary of the Yezd, Kerman and Farsistan
(Shiraz) provinces, the possession of which is
declared by the Governors of all these provinces
not to belong to them, the boundary having
never been properly defined. So robbers can
carry on their evil deeds with comparative
immunity, as they do not come under the jurisdiction
of any of the three Governors in question.
Moreover, if chased by Yezd soldiers, they escape
into Shiraz or Kerman territory, and if pursued
by Kerman troops they escape into either of the
neighbouring provinces, while the Governor of
Shiraz, being the furthest and least interested in
that distant corner of his province, really never
knows and probably does not care to learn what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-412" id="Pg_1-412"></a>[<a href="./images/1-412.png">412</a>]</span>
takes place in so remote and barren a spot. In
any case he will not be held responsible for anything
happening there. It would certainly
involve him in too great expense and difficulty to
send soldiers to live so far into the desert, and
unless in great force they could be of little
assistance to caravans; so that, as things stand,
robber bands have it all their own way.</p>

<p>Strict etiquette is observed between Governors
of provinces and their subordinates, and an encroachment
on one's neighbour's territory would
be considered a most outrageous breach of good
manners and respective rights.</p>

<p>Still travelling quite fast across sand, and with
no brigands in sight, we went on, pleasantly
entertained by the astounding yarns of the two
remaining soldiers. We were told how, twenty
years ago, a foreign doctor&mdash;nationality unknown&mdash;being
attacked by a band of thirty robbers,
produced a small bottle of foreign medicine&mdash;presumably
a most highly concentrated essence
of chloroform&mdash;from his waistcoat pocket and,
having removed the cork, the thirty brigands
immediately fell on all sides in a deep sleep.
The doctor and his party then continued their
journey quietly, and returned several days later
with a number of soldiers, who had no trouble in
despatching the robbers from a temporary into
an eternal sleep, without their waking up at all!</p>

<p>On being asked how it was that the doctor
himself remained awake when such a powerful
narcotic was administered, the narrator did not
lose his presence of mind nor his absence of con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-413" id="Pg_1-413"></a>[<a href="./images/1-413.png">413</a>]</span>science,
and said the doctor had, during the
operation, held his nose tight with his two
fingers. The doctor had since been offered
thousands of tomans for the precious bottle, but
would not part with it.</p>

<p>The soldiers told us a great many more stories
of this type, and they recounted them with such
an <i>aplomb</i> and seriousness that they nearly made
one fall off one's saddle with laughter. Every
now and then they insisted on firing off their
rifles, which I requested them to do some distance
away from my horses. There were no
mishaps.</p>

<p>At Sar-i-Yezd I had not been able to obtain
fresh horses, so the Yezd horses had been taken
on, with an additional donkey. They had gone
splendidly, and we arrived at Zen-u-din shortly
after ten o'clock at night.</p>

<p>Solitary, in the middle of the desert, and by
the side of a salt water well, stands Zen-u-din (Alt.
5,170 feet). There is a chappar station, and
a tumbling-down, circular caravanserai with
massively built watch-towers. These appeared
much battered as if from the result of repeated
attacks.</p>

<p>We left our soldier protectors behind here,
and two more military persons, in rags and with
obsolete guns, insisted on accompanying us, but
as they were on foot and would have delayed
us considerably I paid them off, a hundred yards
from Zen-u-din, and sent them back.</p>

<p>There are mountains extending from the north-east
to the south-east, the Serde Kuh range, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-414" id="Pg_1-414"></a>[<a href="./images/1-414.png">414</a>]</span>
to the south-east they are quite close to the track
and show low passes a mile or so apart by which
the range could easily be crossed. To the west
also we have high hills, some three or four miles
apart from the mountains to the north-east, and
to the north an open desert as far as Yezd. We
notice here again the curious accumulations of
sand high up on the south mountain side, and
also to the south-west of the mountain range
east of us.</p>

<p class="illc">A Trade Caravanserai, Kerman.</p>

<p>At ten in the morning, after a dreary ride
through desolate country, we reached the small
village of Kermanshah (5,300 feet), where a
post station and caravanserai were to be found,
a few trees and, above all, some good drinking
water. From Zen-u-din to Kermanshah, a distance
of sixteen miles (five farsakhs), we had seen
only one solitary tree to the south-west of the
track.</p>

<p>We had now rugged mountains about a mile
to the west and south-west. These were ranges
parallel to one another, the Darestan mountains
being the nearest to us and the Godare Hashimshan
behind them further south-west.</p>

<p>While I was waiting for fresh horses to be got
ready I amused myself at every station studying
the curious inscriptions and ornamentations by
scribbling travellers on the caravanserai and post-house
walls. Laboriously engraved quotations
from the Koran were the most numerous, then
the respective names of travellers, in characters
more or less elaborate according to the education
of the writer, and generally accompanied by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-415" id="Pg_1-415"></a>[<a href="./images/1-415.png">415</a>]</span>
record of the journey, place of birth, and destination
of the scribbler. Occasionally one was
startled by a French inscription in sickening
terms of humility, the work of Persian minor
officials in Government employ, who thus made
a public exhibition of their knowledge of a
foreign language and expounded in glowing
terms their servile admiration for superiors.</p>

<p>More interesting were the records of illiterate
travellers who, in default of literature, placed one
arm and hand upon the whitewashed wall and
traced their silhouette with the point of a knife
or a bit of charcoal or a brush held in the other
hand.</p>

<p>Then came those still more artistically inclined,
who ventured into conventionalised representations
of the peacock with widely-expanded tail&mdash;the
most favourite and frequent of Persian outbursts
of Chappar khana art, and probably the
most emblematic representation of Persian character.
The conventionalised peacock is represented
in a few lines, such as one sees on the
familiar Persian brass trays.</p>

<p>The Shah's portrait with luxuriant moustache
is met in most Chappar khanas scraped somewhere
upon the wall, and not infrequently other
whole human figures drawn in mere lines, such
as children do in our country, but with a greater
profusion of anatomical detail. Very frequent
indeed are the coarse representations of scenes
in daily life, which we generally prefer to leave
unrecorded&mdash;in fact, the artistic genius of the
Persian traveller seems to run very much in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-416" id="Pg_1-416"></a>[<a href="./images/1-416.png">416</a>]</span>
direction, and these drawings are generally the
most elaborate of all, often showing signs of
multiple collaboration.</p>

<p>Horses fully harnessed are occasionally attempted,
but I never saw a camel represented.
Only once did I come across a huge representation
of a ship or a boat. Small birds drawn with
five or six lines only, but quite characteristic of
conventionalised Persian art, were extremely
common, and were the most ingeniously clever of
the lot. Centipedes and occasional scorpions were
now and then attempted with much ingenuity and
faithfulness of detail but no artistic merit.</p>

<p>All these ornamentations, studied carefully,
taught one a good deal of Persian character.
That the Persian is very observant and his mind
very analytical, is quite out of the question, but
his fault lies in the fact that in art as in daily life
minor details strike him long before he can grasp
the larger and more important general view of
what he sees. He prefers to leave that to take
care of itself. We find the same characteristics
not only in his frivolous Chappar khana art&mdash;where
he can be studied unawares and is therefore
quite natural&mdash;but in his more serious art,
in his music, in his business transactions, in his
political work. The lack of simplicity which we
notice in his rude drawings can be detected in
everything else he does, and the evident delight
which he takes in depicting a peacock with its tail
spread in all its glory is nothing more and nothing
less than an expression of what the Persian feels
within himself in relation to his neighbours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-417" id="Pg_1-417"></a>[<a href="./images/1-417.png">417</a>]</span></p>

<p>Nothing has a greater fascination for him than
outward show and pomp. He cares for little
else, and a further proof of this unhappy vainglory
is obtained by the study of the wall scrolls
of the travelling public&mdash;whether travelling
officially or for trading purposes&mdash;representing
in Persia usually the most go-ahead and intelligent
section of the Persian population.</p>

<p>On we go along the dreary track, again on
flat, desolate country of sand and stones at the
spur of the mountains to the west and south-west.
Sand deposits rise at a gentle gradient up
to half the height of these mountains, well
padding their slopes. The track here leads us
due south to a low pass at an altitude of 5,680
feet. One gets so tired of the monotonous
scenery that one would give anything to perceive
something attractive; nor is the monotony of
the journey diminished by two other miserable
nagging soldiers who have clung to us as an
escort from Kermanshah, and who are running
after our horses moaning and groaning and
saying they are starved and tired and have not
received their pay nor their food from the
Government for several months.</p>

<p>On the other side of the pass there is a basin
encircled by mountains, except to the south-east,
where we find an open outlet. The track goes
south-south-east through this yellow plain, and
on proceeding across we find several conical
black mounds with curious patches of a verdigris
colour. To the east rises a low sand dune.</p>

<p>We come in sight of Shemsh, a most forlorn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-418" id="Pg_1-418"></a>[<a href="./images/1-418.png">418</a>]</span>
cheerless place. Sadek gallops ahead with the
<i>horjins</i>, in which he has the cooking pans, some
dead fowls, and a load of vegetables and pomegranates,
and I slow down to give him time to
prepare my lunch. I arrived at the place at
2.45 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> There was only a desolate caravanserai
and a Chappar khana.</p>

<p>On the Yezd-Kerman track there are not more
than three horses at each post station&mdash;at some
there are only two,&mdash;and as I required no less
than five horses, or, if possible, six, I always had
to take on the deficient number of horses from
the previous stations. I generally gave these
horses two or three hours' rest, but it made their
marches very long indeed, as it must be remembered
that on my discharging them they must at
once return to their point of departure. Fortunately,
the traffic was so small by this road that
the horses were in good condition, and so I
was able to proceed at a good rate all along.
Occasionally, one or two horses had to be taken
on for three consecutive stages, which, taking as
an average six farsakhs for each stage, made the
distance they had to travel, including return
journey, six stages, or some 120 miles in all.</p>

<p>The altitude of Shemsh was 5,170 feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I left</span> Shemsh two hours later, at 4.30, and
we travelled over slightly undulating country
on sandy ground with occasional tracts of stones
and gravel. If possible, this part was even more
desolate than the scenery we had found before
reaching here, and not a vestige of vegetation or
animal life could be detected anywhere. When
night descended upon us we had glorious moonlight
to brighten our way, and we marched on
gaily&mdash;this time without the nuisance of an
escort&mdash;until we arrived at Anar at 9.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;seven
farsakhs (about 22 miles) from Shemsh.</p>

<p>From what one could see during our short
stay in the night there appeared to be a large
village, mostly in ruins, with a few trees and a
mud fort. We had gradually descended here to
4,800 feet. The water was quite good. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-420" id="Pg_1-420"></a>[<a href="./images/1-420.png">420</a>]</span>
only allowed ourselves three hours to have our
dinner and sleep, and I ordered the horses to be
ready shortly after midnight.</p>

<p>And here, whatever other faults they may have,
a word of commendation must be put in for the
endurance of Persian servants. It is all very well
for one's self to do with little sleep, but servants
who will go days and days without any at all,
and without a word of complaint or sign of
collapse, are retainers not easily found and not
to be despised. Certainly, one seldom obtains
such qualities in European servants. After doing
fifty or sixty miles on the saddle we would get
off, and I rested awhile, writing up my notes or,
if at night, changing plates in my cameras, but
Sadek never had any rest at all. No sooner had
we jumped off our horses than he had to undo
the saddles and unpack the baggage and kill
fowls and cook my meals, which all took him
some little time; then he had to wash or clean
up everything and repack, and run about the
villages to purchase provisions, and all this kept
him well employed until the hour of departure;
so that, even when I could put in a couple of
hours' sleep of a night, he never had time to
sleep at all. Sleeping on the saddle, of course,
was usual when we travelled by caravan, but was
impossible when chapparing. So that he had
to go several days at a time without a moment's
wink.</p>

<p>The remarkable facility with which, under
these trying circumstances, he got most excellent
meals ready at all hours of the day or night and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-421" id="Pg_1-421"></a>[<a href="./images/1-421.png">421</a>]</span>
in the most outlandish places, and the magic
way in which he could produce fuel and make
a fire out of the most unlikely materials, was
really extraordinary. True, he took himself
and his work most seriously and his pride lay
principally in having no reproach about the
cooking.</p>

<p>He had a smattering of English that was very
quaint. Everything above ground he called
"upstairs"; anything on the ground or below
was "downstairs." Thus, to mount and dismount
a horse was laconically expressed "horse
upstairs," "horse downstairs." Similarly, to lie
down was "downstairs," to get up "upstairs."
Anything involving violent motion was "shoot,"
by which single word to fall, to kick, to bite, to
drop, to jump, to throw away, were defined.
He possessed a good vocabulary of swear words&mdash;which
he had learnt from sailors at Bushire&mdash;and
these served him well when anything went
wrong; but I forbade him to use them in my
presence as I wished to have the monopoly myself,
and thus his English vocabulary was very
much curtailed. The remainder of his English
conversation applied entirely to cooking chickens.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight we moved out of the
Chappar khana, and, barring some slight cultivation
in the immediate neighbourhood of the
village, we soon entered again upon the flat, sandy
desert. We had a lovely full moon over us,
which added to the pleasure of travelling, and we
rode on to Bayas (five farsakhs), some seventeen
or eighteen miles, where we arrived at five in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-422" id="Pg_1-422"></a>[<a href="./images/1-422.png">422</a>]</span>
morning. The altitude of this place was exactly
the same as that of Anar, 4,800 feet.</p>

<p>Bayas is a tiny village with a few mulberry
trees and a small stream of water. It has a fair
caravanserai. We rested the horses for a couple
of hours, while I had breakfast, and by 7.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
we were again in our saddles.</p>

<p>To the south-west and north-east by east we
again perceived the familiar high sand deposits, all
along the base of the mountain ranges, and they
reached up to two-thirds of the height of the
mountains, forming a smooth, inclined plane
rising very gently from the flat desert on which
we were travelling. To the north-east by east the
sand-banks rose nearly to the summit of the hill
range.</p>

<p>Sadek and the chappar boy pointed out to me
a village to the north-east of the track, and
informed me that all its inhabitants were robbers
and murderers. In fact upon the road, we came
across a poor boy crying, and bruised all over.
We asked him what was the matter. He pointed
to three men in the distance who were running
away, and said they had beaten him and stolen
his money, two krans, and two pomegranates.
Sure enough, when we galloped to the men and
stopped them they did not wait to be accused
but handed me at once both fruit and money to
be returned to their rightful owner.</p>

<p>These folks had very brutal faces, framed in
flowing locks of shaggy hair. They were garbed
in long thick coats of white felt, made entirely
of one piece, and quite stiff, with sleeves sticking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-423" id="Pg_1-423"></a>[<a href="./images/1-423.png">423</a>]</span>
out at the sides, into which the arms were never
to be inserted. There were two red and blue
small circular ornamentations at the bottom of
the coat in front, and one in the centre of the
back, as on Japanese kimonos.</p>

<p>We began to see more habitations now, and
about one mile north-east of the track we perceived
the villages of Esmalawat, Aliabad, and
Sher-i-fabad,&mdash;the latter quite a large place. We
still went on over sand and white salt deposits.</p>

<p>Poor Sadek was so tired and sleepy that he fell
off his horse a couple of times. The soil got
very stony on getting near Kushkuhyeh (altitude
4,900 feet), where we entered the Chappar khana
exactly at noon.</p>

<p>The contractor of the postal service lived at
this village, and he was extremely civil. As
many as eight horses were in his stable, and he
ordered that the best should be given me. He
entertained me to tea and took the keenest interest
in my rifles. He also possessed one of the
familiar discarded British Martini military rifles,
specially decorated for the Persian market&mdash;a
rifle worth at its most a pound sterling, or two,
but for which he had paid no less than 100
tomans (about &pound;20). The smugglers of firearms
must have made huge profits on the sale of these
antiquated weapons, for firearms are among the
few articles for which large sums of ready money
can be obtained in Persia.</p>

<p>This particular man now took a great fancy to
my .256 Mannlicher, and jokingly said he would
not let me proceed until I had sold it to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-424" id="Pg_1-424"></a>[<a href="./images/1-424.png">424</a>]</span>
He produced large sums in solid silver to tempt
me, about four times the value of the rifle, and
was greatly upset when I assured him that I
would not part with the rifle at all.</p>

<p>When I left, he accompanied me part of the
way, some few hundred yards, and he took with
him his Martini and a belt full of cartridges; his
servant who followed him was also similarly
armed. On inquiring of him why master and
servant loaded themselves with arms and ammunition
to go such a short distance, he replied
that it was not safe for him to go unarmed even
one yard out of his house. One of his friends
had been murdered only a few days before, and
one never knows in Persia when one's turn will
come next. In out-of-the-way places in Persia
private revenge is extremely common, which
generally takes the form of shooting one's adversary
in the back.</p>

<p>There seemed to be abundance of water at
Kushkuhyeh, and the fields were properly irrigated.
Cultivation seemed prosperous, and vast
cotton plantations were to be seen all round.
When we passed, hundreds of men, women and
children were busy taking in the cotton, and
scores of camels, donkeys, sheep and goats grazing
were dotting the green patch in the landscape.
This gay scene of active life and verdure
was all the more refreshing after the many miles
of sand and gravel and barren hills of which we
had grown so weary since leaving Yezd.</p>

<p>Two hours were wasted for lunch, and off we
went again. On leaving behind Kushkuhyeh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-425" id="Pg_1-425"></a>[<a href="./images/1-425.png">425</a>]</span>
we also left behind vegetation, and again we sank
in sand. A few tamarisk shrubs were scattered
here and there on the large plain we were
traversing, bounded on all sides by distant
mountains.</p>

<p>Three and a half farsakhs (about 13 miles) saw
us at Hemmatawat, a large walled enclosure.</p>

<p>At 6.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we entered the small town of
Barawamad (Bahramabad)&mdash;altitude 5,150 feet&mdash;or
Rafsenju as it is called now by its new name.
This is a fast-growing place of quite modern
origin, and it owes most of its prosperity to the
extensive cultivation of cotton, exported from
here direct to the Persian Gulf and India.</p>

<p>Besides the route on which we are travelling
there are several other tracks leading out of
Barawamad. A minor one runs in a north-easterly
direction, over the Dehring Mountains
to the Seroenan district, where many villages are
to be found, and then turns sharply south-east
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Zerend to Kerman. It is also possible, when
once one has crossed into Seroenan, to continue
to Lawah (Rawar) and then, across the Salt
Desert, to Meshed or to Birjand.</p>

<p>To the Persian Gulf there are three tracks.
One south-west by west to Sher-i-balek, from
which place the traveller has the option to travel
to Bushire (<i>vi&acirc;</i> Shiraz) or to Lingah or to Bandar
Abbas <i>vi&acirc;</i> Forg. Two different tracks, to Reshitabad
and Bidu, join at Melekabad (south-west)
and these eventually enter the Kerman-Shiraz-Bushire
track; while another track, the most in
use, goes almost due south, direct to Bidu,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-426" id="Pg_1-426"></a>[<a href="./images/1-426.png">426</a>]</span>
skirting the Pariz Mountains on their westerly
slopes. This track, too, crosses the Kerman-Shiraz
route at Saidabad, and proceeds due south
to Bandar Abbas.</p>

<p>The few Hindoo merchants of Kerman come
here during the cotton season to make their
purchases and send their goods direct to Bandar
Abbas for shipment to India. Pottery of an
inferior kind is manufactured at Rafsenju.</p>

<p>We left the Chappar khana at midnight in a
terrific cold wind, and this time on shockingly
bad horses. They were tired and lame, the cold
wind probably intensifying the rheumatic pains
from which most of them were suffering. The
country was undulating and we gradually rose to
5,700 feet. The horses gave us no end of
trouble and we had to walk the greater portion
of the night.</p>

<p>Sadek, five feet two in height, and the
Chappar boy, six feet two, came to words and
soon after to most sonorous blows. To add to
our comfort, the Chappar boy, who got the
worst of the scrimmage, ran away, and it was
only at sunrise that we perceived him again a
long way off following us, not daring to get too
near. Eventually, by dint of sending him peaceful
messages by a caravan man who passed us,
Sadek induced him to return, and still struggling
in the sand of the desolate country all round us,
and our horses sinking quite deep into it, we
managed to drag men, horses, and loads into
Kafter-han (Kebuter-han)&mdash;altitude 5,680 feet&mdash;at
8.30 in the morning, where we were glad to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-427" id="Pg_1-427"></a>[<a href="./images/1-427.png">427</a>]</span>
get relays of fresh steeds. We had gone about
twenty-eight miles from the last station.</p>

<p>A few mud huts, an ice store-house, a flour
mill, a high building, said to have been an
arsenal, the usual caravanserai, and a dingy
Chappar khana were all, quite all one could rest
one's eye upon at Kafter-han. There was some
cultivation, but nothing very luxuriant. The
few inhabitants were quite interested in the
sudden appearance of a <i>ferenghi</i> (a foreigner).
The women, who were not veiled here, were
quite good-looking, one girl particularly, whose
photograph I snatched before she had time to
run away to hide herself&mdash;the usual effect of a
camera on Persian women, quite the reverse to
its effects on the European fair sex.</p>

<p>We left almost directly on better animals, and
proceeded south-east having lofty rugged hills to
the north-east, east, and south of us, with the
usual high sand accumulations upon their sides.
To the south-east we could just discern the
distant mountains near Kerman. The track
itself, on the sandy embankment at the foot of
the hillside to the south-west, is rather high up
and tortuous, owing to a very long salt marsh
which fills the lower portion of the valley during
the rainy weather and makes progress in a straight
line impossible. But now, owing to the absolute
absence of rain for months and months, the
marsh was perfectly dry and formed a flat white
plastered stretch of clay, sand and salt, as smooth
as a billiard-table, and not unlike an immense
floor prepared for tennis-courts. The dried salt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-428" id="Pg_1-428"></a>[<a href="./images/1-428.png">428</a>]</span>
mud was extremely hard, our horses' hoofs
leaving scarcely a mark on it. I reckoned the
breadth of this flat, white expanse at one and a
half miles, and its length a little over eleven
miles. Two high peaks stood in front of us to
the south-east, the Kuh Djupahr, forming part
of a long range extending in a south-east direction.</p>

<p>At a distance of four farsakhs (about thirteen
miles), and directly on the other side of the dried-up
salt stretch, we came to another Chappar khana,
at the village of Robat. There were a good
many women about in front of the huge caravanserai,
and they looked very ridiculous in the tiny
short skirts like those of ballet girls, and not
particularly clean, over tight trousers quite adhering
to the legs.</p>

<p>We have the same mountains on both sides,
and we continue over undulating ground, the
valley getting somewhat narrower as we proceed
towards Baghih. Six or seven miles from Kafter-han
was Esmaratabad village, a mass of ruins, and
ten miles or so a large village, still in fair preservation,
Sadi, with some vegetation, principally
wheat. The track lay mostly over a stony,
barren desert, with here and there, miles and
miles apart, a forced patch of green.</p>

<p>Baghih, our last halt before reaching Kerman,
was nine farsakhs from Kafter-han. It stood at
an elevation of 5,740 feet, and had plenty of excellent
water. The village was large, with handsome
walled gardens and nicely-kept wheat-fields
all round. The inhabitants were most affable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-429" id="Pg_1-429"></a>[<a href="./images/1-429.png">429</a>]</span>
and civil, and the women and children particularly
simple and attractive. The girls were
attired in longer and more graceful skirts than
the damsels of Robat, and did not leave the leg
exposed even as high as the knee. Over it they
had an ample shirt with wide short sleeves,
showing their gracefully modelled and well
rounded arms, adorned with metal bracelets. On
the head was a kerchief neatly bound quite tight
over the head by means of a ribbon.</p>

<p>It was not possible to get fresh horses here,
and mine were very tired or I would have continued
to Kerman the same evening, completing
the journey from Yezd (220 miles) in three days.
We had arrived early in the afternoon, and had
I not been compelled to take on the tired horses for
the remaining four farsakhs (13 miles) I could
have easily reached Kerman before the gates of
the city were closed at sunset. As it was, I had to
give it up, and had to sleep the night at Baghih,
making an early start on Wednesday, the 30th.</p>

<p>Baghih is actually south-west of Kerman, and
the track makes this long detour to avoid the
Bademan Mountains to the north. It thus passes
over comparatively level land in the valley between
that range and the Kuh Djupahr, the
track turning here sharply to the north-east, in
which direction, when we get to the highest
point of the track (5,980 feet) one and a half
farsakhs from Baghih, we can almost discern
Kerman in the distance. Except to the north-west
we have high mountains all round, the highest
being the Djupahr to the south-east, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-430" id="Pg_1-430"></a>[<a href="./images/1-430.png">430</a>]</span>
which we now get a most lovely view, and also
of the whole Kerman plain with its innumerable
semi-spherical sand-hills.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Djupahr below us we see
the two villages of Kheirabad and Akhibarabad,
with many trees and some cultivation round them.
On descending into the Kerman plain we have
deceiving effects of mirage, lovely lakes on both
sides and streams of water, but on the rising of a
gentle breeze, limpid lakes and streams suddenly
disappear, and the whole plain is nothing but a
big undulating stretch of yellow sand, until we
arrive within almost a stone's-throw of the city
gates of Kerman.</p>

<p>At 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on Wednesday, October the 30th,
I halted at the palatial Chappar khana of Kerman,
just outside the city wall, in a handsome garden,
having accomplished the journey from Yezd in
four days, including halts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was my intention to pay my respects to the
British Consul for whom I had letters of introduction
from the Minister at Teheran, and I at
once proceeded through the city, entering first
the "Ark" or citadel, and then the south-west
gate with two side columns of green and blue
tiles in a spiral design and pointed archway, into
the Meidan&mdash;a fine rectangular square of great
length and breadth. Sentries posted at the gates
of the city and at the sides of the square saluted,
and also many of the people along the road.
This extraordinary civility was very refreshing in
a country where one only expects extreme rudeness
from the lower classes.</p>

<p>We entered the vaulted bazaar, the main big
artery of Kerman city, intersected about half-way
by a tortuous street from north to south and by
other minor narrow lanes, and crowded with
people, donkeys, camels and mules; and here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-432" id="Pg_1-432"></a>[<a href="./images/1-432.png">432</a>]</span>
too, one was rather surprised to see various
merchants get up in their shops salaaming as I
passed, and to receive a "Salameleko" and a bow
from most men on the way. The bazaar itself,
being in appearance more ancient than those of
Yezd, Isfahan and Teheran, was more alluring
and had many quaint bits. It bore, however,
very much the same characteristics as all other
bazaars of Persia. At the end of it on the
north-east we emerged into an open space with
picturesque awnings, suspended mats, and spread
umbrellas shading innumerable baskets of delicious
green figs, trays of grapes, and pomegranates,
piles of water-melons and vegetables of
all sorts.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-54.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-54_th.jpg" alt="H. E. Ala-el-Mulk, Governor of Kerman, in his Palace." title="H. E. Ala-el-Mulk, Governor of Kerman, in his Palace." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">H. E. Ala-el-Mulk, Governor of Kerman, in his Palace.</p>

<p>No Europeans live within the wall of Kerman
city itself, and at the time of my visit there were
only four Europeans altogether residing in the
neighbourhood of the town. Two missionaries,
husband and wife; a gentleman who, misled by
representations, had been induced to come from
India to dig artesian wells at great expense&mdash;in
a country where the natives are masters at
finding water and making aqueducts&mdash;and our
most excellent Consul, Major Phillott, one of
the most practical and sensible men that ever
lived.</p>

<p>The Consulate was at Zeris or Zirisf, some
little distance to the east of the town. We
passed through a graveyard on leaving the inhabited
district, and had in front of us some
ancient fortifications on the rocky hills to the
south, which we skirted, and then came to some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-433" id="Pg_1-433"></a>[<a href="./images/1-433.png">433</a>]</span>
huge conical ice-houses&mdash;very old, but still in
excellent preservation. We passed the solidly-built
and foreign-looking gateway of the Bagh-i-Zeris,
and a little further at the end of a short
avenue the British flag could be seen flying upon
a gate.</p>

<p>As I came upon him a ragged infantry soldier,
who, being at his dinner, was busy licking his
fingers, sprang to his feet and made a military
salute. Having passed through a court and a
garden and a series of dismantled rooms I found
myself in the Consulate, where I was greeted
effusively by Major Phillott, who had no idea I
was coming, and who, owing to my being very
much sun-tanned, had at first mistaken me for a
Persian! He would not hear of my remaining
at the Chappar khana, and most kindly sent at
once for all my luggage to be brought up to the
Consulate. The hospitality of Englishmen in
Persia is really unbounded.</p>

<p>H. E. Ala-el-Mulk, Governor of Kerman,
called on the Consul that same afternoon, and I
was able to present the letter I had brought to
him. Having lived long in Europe Ala-el-Mulk
is a most fluent French scholar, and, being a man
of considerable talent, sense, and honesty he is
rather adverse to the empty show and pomp
which is ever deemed the necessary accompaniment
of high-placed officials in Persia. He can
be seen walking through the town with only a
servant or two, or riding about inspecting every
nook of his city hardly attended at all. This,
curiously enough, has not shocked the natives as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-434" id="Pg_1-434"></a>[<a href="./images/1-434.png">434</a>]</span>
people feared, but, on the contrary, has inspired
them with intense respect for the new Governor,
whose tact, gentleness, consideration and justice
were fully appreciated by the whole town; so
that, after all, it is pleasant to notice that the
lower classes of Persia have more common sense
and power of differentiation than they have
hitherto been credited with.</p>

<p>"When I want anything well done," said the
Governor to me, "I do it myself. I want the
welfare of my people and am only glad when I
can see with my own eyes that they get it. I
inspect my soldiers, I see them drilled before
me; I go to the bazaar to talk to the people,
and any one can come to talk to me. Nobody
need be afraid of coming to me; I am ever
ready to listen to all."</p>

<p>Although this innovation in the system of
impressing the crowds created somewhat of a
sensation at first, the Governor soon managed to
impress the people with his own personality, and
he is now extraordinarily popular among all
classes, except the semi-official, who cannot
carry on their usual extortions with impunity.</p>

<p>He asked me to go and inspect his troops,
whom he had drilled before his own eyes every
morning, and undoubtedly, of all the soldiers I
had seen in Persia, they were the only ones&mdash;barring
the Cossack regiments drilled by Russians&mdash;that
had a real military appearance and were
trained according to a method. They were better
dressed, better fed, and more disciplined even
than the soldiers of Teheran.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-435" id="Pg_1-435"></a>[<a href="./images/1-435.png">435</a>]</span></p>

<p>The teaching of music to recruits for the band
was quite interesting. The musical notes were
written on a black-board and the young fellows
were made to sing them out in a chorus until
they had learnt the whole melody by heart.
The boys had most musical voices and quite
good musical ears, while their powers of
retention of what they were taught were quite
extraordinary, when it was considered that these
fellows were recruited from the lowest and most
ignorant classes.</p>

<p>The garrison of Kerman was armed with
Vrandel rifles, an old, discarded European pattern,
but quite serviceable. Anyhow, all the men
possessed rifles of one and the same pattern,
which was an advantage not noticeable in the
Teheran troops, for instance. For Persians, they
went through their drill in an accurate and
business-like manner, mostly to the sound of
three drums, and also with a capital band playing
European brass instruments.</p>

<p>The Governor took special delight in showing
me several tents which he had had specially
manufactured for his approaching campaign, in
conjunction with British troops from British
Beluchistan, against marauding Beluch tribes
who had been very troublesome for some time,
and who, being so close to the frontier, were able
to evade alike Persian, Beluch, and British law,
until a joint movement against them was made
from west and east. H. E. Ala-el-Mulk told me
that he intended to command the expedition
himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-436" id="Pg_1-436"></a>[<a href="./images/1-436.png">436</a>]</span></p>

<p>Ala-el-Mulk, a man extraordinarily courteous
and simple in manner, was former Persian Ambassador
in Constantinople. Through no fault
of his own, owing to certain customs prevalent
at the Sultan's court, the Shah during his visit to
Constantinople was unreasonably displeased, and
the Ambassador was recalled. The Governorship
of distant Kerman was given him, but a man like
Ala-el-Mulk, one of the ablest men in Persia,
would be more useful in a higher position nearer
the capital, if not in the capital itself. Kerman
is a very out-of-the-way place, and of no very
great importance just yet, although, if Persia
develops as she should, it will not be many
years from the present time before Kerman
becomes a place of great importance to England.</p>

<p>However, Ala-el-Mulk is, above all, a philosopher,
and he certainly makes the best of his
opportunities. He has to contend with many
difficulties, intrigue, false dealing, and corruption
being rampant even among some of the
higher officials in the town; but with his
sound judgment and patience he certainly
manages to keep things going in a most satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>Besides his official business, and with the aid of
his nephew, he superintends the manufacture, as
we have already seen, of the best, the most characteristically
Persian carpets of the finest quality
and dyes. There are a great many looms in the
buildings adjacent to the Palace and hundreds
of hands employed in the Governor's factories.
He also possesses a good collection of very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-437" id="Pg_1-437"></a>[<a href="./images/1-437.png">437</a>]</span>
ancient carpets, from which the modern ones
are copied.</p>

<p>I returned his visit at his Palace, where the
Consul and I were received most cordially and
had a lengthy and most interesting conversation
with his Excellency. Then he showed me all
the buildings in the Ark.</p>

<p>Kerman is celebrated for its cloth manufacture
and felts. The cloth is of fine worsted, and is
generally in pieces six yards long by three quarters
of a yard wide. It is much used by the
natives, both for hangings and for making clothes
for men and women, being very soft and durable.
Embroidered turbans and kamarbands are made
from these cloths, especially in white cloth, generally
of a fine quality. The process of weaving
these cloths, called inappropriately "Kerman
shawls," is identical with that of the loom
described at the village of Bambis in Chapter
XXXVI. The material used for the best
quality is the selected fine wool, growing next
to the skin of goats. These dyed threads are
cut into short lengths and woven into the fabric
by the supple and agile fingers of the children
working, packed tight together, at the looms.
Some of the best cloths, not more than ten feet
in length, take as long as a month per foot in
their manufacture, and they realise very high
prices, even as much as nine or ten pounds
sterling a yard. The design on the more
elaborate ones is, as in the carpets, learnt by
heart, the stitches being committed to memory
like the words of a poem. This is not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-438" id="Pg_1-438"></a>[<a href="./images/1-438.png">438</a>]</span>
however, the case with the simpler and cheaper
ones, which are more carelessly done, a boy
reading out the design from a pattern or a
book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A visit</span> to the Madrassah on the north side
of the bazaar was extremely interesting, it being
the best preserved building of that type I had so
far seen in Persia. The Consul and I were
shown round it by the Son of Sirkar Agha, the
head of the Sheikhi sect, a most dignified individual
with long black cloak and ample white
turban, and with a beard dyed as black as ink.
He conversed most intelligently and took great
delight in showing every nook of the building.</p>

<p>The college is only some ninety years old. Its
courts, its walls, its rooms, its dome, are most
beautifully tiled all over, and, strange to say, it
is kept in good repair and the gardens are well
looked after. There is a handsome lecture-hall,
with four strong receptacles high up in the
corners of the room, and fret-work at the
windows, not unlike Egyptian <i>musharabeahs</i>.
Four very high ventilating shafts are constructed
over the buildings to keep the rooms cool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-440" id="Pg_1-440"></a>[<a href="./images/1-440.png">440</a>]</span></p>

<p>"Peace on Abraham" reads an elaborate
inscription, quoted from the Koran, but applying
in this case, Sirkar Agha's son tells me, to the
founder of the institution. There are other
inscriptions on the towers and ventilating shafts.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit the number of pupils
was two hundred. The adjoining Hammam
belonging to the College was, to our astonishment,
also shown us. Such baths are underground
and are reached by steps or by a slippery
incline. These particular ones were very superior
and had a beautifully tiled entrance, but the door
itself was small and always kept closed. The
first room was domed with a fountain playing
in the centre and platforms, three feet high
all round, on the matting of which lay spread
a great many cotton towels, red and blue. The
only light came from a centre aperture in the
dome. High earthen jugs stood artistically
resting against one another, and a few people
were dressing or undressing preparatory to taking
or after having taken a bath. This was all that
was done in this room.</p>

<p>Through a narrow slippery passage we entered
another room, where the steamy heat was considerable.
There were small sections round the
room divided by a wall, like the cells of a
monastery, and in each cell was a tap of cold
water. Then we ascended through a small
aperture into another and warmer room, spacious
enough, but stifling with a sickening acid odour
of perspiration and fumes of over-heated human
skins. The steam heat was so great that one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-441" id="Pg_1-441"></a>[<a href="./images/1-441.png">441</a>]</span>
saw everything in a haze, and one felt one's
own pores expand and one's clothes get quite
wet with the absorbed damp in the atmosphere
over-saturated with moisture.</p>

<p>There were two or three men, stripped and
only with a loin cloth, lying down flat on their
backs,&mdash;one undergoing massage, being thumped
all over; another having the hair of his head
and beard dyed jet-black. The reason that the
Persian hair-dyes are so permanent is principally
because the dyeing is done at such a high
temperature and in such moist atmosphere which
allows the dye to get well into the hair. When
the same dyes are used at a normal temperature
the results are never so successful. Further, a
third man was being cleansed by violent rubbing.
He needed it badly; at least, judging by the
amount of black stuff that rolled from his skin
under the operator's fingers. The attendants,
too, barring a loin-cloth, were naked.</p>

<p>With perspiration streaming down my cheeks
I took the photographs here reproduced, and
then proceeded to a yet hotter small room&mdash;as
suffocating a place as one may wish to enter in
one's lifetime, or after! One received a positive
scorching blow in the face as one entered it,
the heat was so great. This is the last chamber,
and in a corner is a tap of cold water with which
the skin is repeatedly rinsed and made to sweat
several times until the pores are considered absolutely
clean. There were two people lying down
in a semi-unconscious state, and although I was
only there a few minutes I came out quite limp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-442" id="Pg_1-442"></a>[<a href="./images/1-442.png">442</a>]</span>
and rag-like. It ruined my watch, and only by
very careful nursing I was able to save my
camera from falling to pieces. On returning to
the previous hot chamber it seemed quite cool
by comparison, and when we emerged again into
the open air, thermometer about 90&deg; in the shade,
one felt quite chilled.</p>

<p>The various trade caravanserais, of which there
were over a dozen in Kerman on either side of
the main bazaar street, were quite interesting.
They were large courts with high platforms, six
to ten feet high, all round them, the centre well,
enclosed by them, being tightly packed with
camels, mules and donkeys. Above on the broad
platform lay all the packs of merchandise which
had arrived from Birjand and Afghanistan, from
Beluchistan or from India <i>via</i> Bandar Abbas.
The shops and store rooms were neat and had
wood-work in front, with gigantic padlocks of a
primitive make. Some, however, had neat little
English padlocks.</p>

<p class="illc">The Interior of a Hammam or Bath&mdash;First Room.</p>

<p>The most interesting to us, but not the most
beautiful, was the Hindoo caravanserai, where
some forty British Hindoo merchants carried on
their commerce. The place looked old and
untidy, and the shops overcrowded with cheap
articles of foreign make, such as are commonly
to be seen in India,&mdash;paraffin lamps, knives,
enamelled ware, cotton goods, indigo, tea, sugar
and calicos being prominent in the shops. The
piece goods come mostly from Germany and
Austria, the cottons from Manchester.</p>

<p>The Hindoos were very civil and entertained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-443" id="Pg_1-443"></a>[<a href="./images/1-443.png">443</a>]</span>
us to tea, water melon, and a huge tray of sweets,
while a crowd outside gazed at the unusual sight
of Europeans visiting the caravanserais. The
merchants said that the trade in cotton, wool,
gum and dates was fairly good, and that, taking
things all round, matters went well, but they had
a great many complaints&mdash;they would not be
Hindoos if they had not&mdash;of petty quarrels to be
settled among themselves and with the Persians.
These, of course, arose mostly out of matters of
money. They seemed otherwise quite jolly and
happy, notwithstanding the exaggerated hats and
curious costumes they are compelled to wear, so
that they may be distinguished at a glance from
the Persians themselves.</p>

<p>Here, too, as has been already said, there is a
small Parsee community of about 3,000 souls.
They are, however, rather scattered nowadays,
and are not so prominent as in Yezd.</p>

<p>The side streets leading out of the bazaar are
narrow and dingy, covered up in places with
awnings and matting. There is very little else
worth seeing in the city, but the many ruins to
the east of the town and the ancient fortifications
are well worth a visit.</p>

<p>It is to the east of the city that the ancient
fortifications are found, on the most western
portion of the crescent-shaped barrier of mountains.
According to some natives the smaller
fort, the Kala-i-Dukhtar, or Virgin fort, on the
terminal point of the range, at one time formed
part of ancient Kerman. The fort, the Kala-i-Dukhtar
is on the ridge of the hill, with a fairly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-444" id="Pg_1-444"></a>[<a href="./images/1-444.png">444</a>]</span>
well-preserved castellated wall and a large doorway
in the perpendicular rock at the end of the
hill range.</p>

<p>In a long semicircular wall at the foot of the
hill a row of niches can be seen, but whether
these made part of an ancient stable for horses,
or were used for other purposes, I could not
quite ascertain. Some people said that they were
a portion of a <i>hammam</i>; others said they might
have been cells of a prison, but what remained
of them was not sufficient to allow one to come
to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p class="figcenter">(Kala Ardeshir on summit of mountain) Kerman.</p>

<p>The outside wall of the fort was very high,
and had strong battlements and towers. Inside
the lower wall at the foot of the hill was a moat
from twenty-five to thirty feet wide and fifteen
feet deep. The upper wall went along the
summit of two ridges and was parallel to the
lower one, which had four large circular turrets,
and extended down to and over the flat for some
120 yards. There was another extensive but
much demolished fortress to the east of this
on the lower part of the hill range, guarding
the other side of the entrance of the pass, and
this, too, had two large walled enclosures in the
plain at its foot. A great many fragments of
pottery with angular geometrical patterns and
small circles upon them were to be found here
and in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The fort of Kala-i-Dukhtar is attributed by
the people to King Ardishir, and is one of the
three mentioned by Mukaddasi in the tenth
century, who, in describing the city of Bardasir,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-445" id="Pg_1-445"></a>[<a href="./images/1-445.png">445</a>]</span>
unmistakably identified with the present Kerman,
speaks of the three famous impregnable castles&mdash;the
<i>Hisn</i> defended by a ditch, evidently the one
above described, directly outside the city gate,
and the old castle, the Kala-i-Kuh, on the crest
of the hill. It has been assumed that the third
castle mentioned by Mukaddasi, was where the
<i>Ark</i> or citadel is now, but personally I doubt
whether this is correct. The citadel, the
residence of the present Governor, is to my mind
of much more recent origin. There is every
sign to make one doubt whether Kerman
extended in those days as far west as the citadel,
which to-day occupies the most western point
outside the city; whereas in the accounts of
Mukaddasi one would be led to understand that
the third fortress was well within the city near a
great mosque. In Persian chronicles, too, the
Hill Castle, the old, and the new castles are
often referred to, but personally I believe that
these three castles were adjoining one another
on the same chain of hills.</p>

<p>An ascent to the Kala Ardeshir well repays
the trouble of getting there. It is not possible
to reach the Castle from the south side, where
the rocky hills are very precipitous, and even
from the north it is not easy of access. On the
north-west side, facing the British Consulate, there
is a somewhat narrow and slippery track in the
rock along a ravine, by which&mdash;in many places
"on all fours"&mdash;one can get up to the top.</p>

<p>The gateway is very much blocked with sand,
but squeezing through a small aperture one can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-446" id="Pg_1-446"></a>[<a href="./images/1-446.png">446</a>]</span>
get inside the wall, within which are several
small courts, and a series of tumbled-down small
buildings. In the walls can still be seen some of
the receptacles in which grain and food were
formerly stored.</p>

<p class="illc"><a href="./images/ill1-60.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-60_th.jpg" alt="Graveyard and Kala-i-Dukhtar or Virgin Fort, Kerman." title="Graveyard and Kala-i-Dukhtar or Virgin Fort, Kerman." /></a></p>
<p class="illc">Graveyard and Kala-i-Dukhtar or Virgin Fort, Kerman.</p>

<p>Although the exterior of the castle, resting
on the solid rock and built of sun-dried bricks so
welded together by age as to form a solid mass,
appears in fair preservation from a distance, when
one examines the interior it is found to be in a
dreadful state of decay. The courts and spaces
between the walls are now filled up with sand.
There is a well of immense depth, bored in the
rock, the fort standing some five hundred feet
above the plain; but although this is said by some
writers to have been a way of escape from this
fortress to as distant a place as Khabis, some forty-five
miles as the crow flies to the east of Kerman,
I never heard this theory expounded in Kerman
itself, but in any case, it is rather strange that
the well should have been made so small in
diameter as hardly to allow the passage of a
man, its shaft being bored absolutely perpendicular
for hundreds and hundreds of feet and
its sides perfectly smooth, so that an attempt
to go down it would be not a way of escape
from death, but positive suicide. The well was
undoubtedly made to supply the fort with water
whenever it became impracticable to use the
larger wells and tanks constructed at the foot of
the hills within the fortification walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> very large deserted city of Farmidan lies
directly south of the mountainous crescent on
which are found the fortifications described in
the previous chapter. The houses of the city do
not appear very ancient, their walls being in excellent
preservation, but not so the domed roofs
which have nearly all fallen in. The houses are
entirely constructed of sun-dried mud bricks, now
quite soldered together by age and reduced into
a compact mass. A few of the more important
dwellings have two storeys, and all the buildings
evidently had formerly domed roofs. In order
that the conformation of each house may be
better understood, a plan of one typical building
is given. On a larger or smaller scale they all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-448" id="Pg_1-448"></a>[<a href="./images/1-448.png">448</a>]</span>
resembled one another very closely, and were not
unlike the Persian houses of to-day.</p>

<p>There was a broad main road at the foot of
the mountains along the southern side of which
the city had been built, with narrow and tortuous
streets leading out of the principal thoroughfare.
Curiously enough, however, this city appeared
not to have had a wall round it like most other
cities one sees in Persia. It is possible that the
inhabitants relied on taking refuge in the strength
and safety of the forts above, but more probable
seems the theory that Farmidan was a mere
settlement, a place of refuge of the Zoroastrians
who had survived the terrible slaughter by Agha
Muhammed Khan.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that when the Afghan
determined to regain his throne or die, he came
over the Persian frontier from Kandahar. He
crossed the Salt Desert from Sistan, losing thousands
of men, horses and camels on the way, and
with a large army still under his command,
eventually occupied Kerman.</p>

<p>Kerman was in those days a most flourishing
commercial centre, with bazaars renowned for
their beauty and wealth, and its forts were well
manned and considered impregnable. So unexpected,
however, was the appearance of such
a large army that the inhabitants made no resistance
and readily bowed to the sovereignty of
Agha Muhammed. They were brutally treated
by the oppressors. Luft-Ali-Khan hastened from
the coast to the relief of the city, and fiercely
attacked and defeated the Afghan invader, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-449" id="Pg_1-449"></a>[<a href="./images/1-449.png">449</a>]</span>
was compelled to retreat to Kandahar; but
Kerman city, which had undergone terrible
oppression from the entry of the Afghans, fared
no better at the hands of the Persians. The
Zoroastrians of Kerman particularly were massacred
wholesale or compelled to adopt the
Mahommedan religion.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely&mdash;although I assume no
responsibility for the statement&mdash;that at that
time the Zoroastrians, who were still numerous
in Kerman, driven from their homes by the
invading Afghan and Persian armies, settled
a few miles from the city, unable to proceed
further afield owing to the desolate nature of the
country all round. With no animals, no means
of subsistence, it would have been impossible for
them with their families to go much further
<i>en masse</i> in a country where food and even
water are not easily obtainable. The name of
the town&mdash;Farmidan&mdash;also would point to the
conclusion that it had been inhabited by Fars,
and the age attributed to the city by the natives
corresponds roughly with the epoch of the
Afghan invasion.</p>

<p>To the north of Kerman city we have another
similar settlement, now deserted, Mahala-Giabr
(a corruption of Guebre), of which there is little
doubt that it was inhabited by Zoroastrians. One
of the reasons that these cities are now deserted
may be found in the fact that Agha Muhammed,
having raised another army in Afghanistan, proceeded
a second time to the conquest of Persia.
The Zoroastrians, who had fared worse at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-450" id="Pg_1-450"></a>[<a href="./images/1-450.png">450</a>]</span>
hands of Luft-Ali-Khan than under the Afghan
rule, were persuaded to join Agha Muhammed
against their Perso-Arab oppressors, in hopes of
obtaining some relief to their misery, but history
does not relate what became of them. They
were never heard of again. One fact only is
known, that very few of those living in Kerman
at the time succeeded in escaping massacre.
That previous to this the Zoroastrians must have
been very numerous in Kerman can be judged
by the remains of many fire-temples to be seen,
especially in the neighbourhood of the city.</p>

<p>In his second invasion of Persia Agha Muhammed
again reached Kerman in 1795 and
besieged the city defended by Luft-Ali-Khan.
The inhabitants, who had suffered at the hands
of their saviours as much if not more than at
those of their oppressors, made a half-hearted
resistance and eventually, in the thick of the
fighting, the city gates were opened by treachery.
Luft-Ali-Khan and a handful of his faithful men
fought like lions in the streets of the city, but at
last, seeing that all hope of victory had vanished,
and forsaken by most of his men, Luft-Ali-Khan
rode full gallop in the midst of the Afghans.
According to chronicles, he defiantly ran the
gauntlet with only three followers, and they
were able to force their way through the Kajar
post and escape to Bam-Narmanshir, the most
eastern part of the Kerman province, on the
borders of Sistan.</p>

<p>Agha Muhammed demanded the surrender of
Luft-Ali-Khan; the city was searched to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-451" id="Pg_1-451"></a>[<a href="./images/1-451.png">451</a>]</span>
him, and when it was learned that he had succeeded
in effecting an escape, the wrath of the
Afghan knew no bounds. The people having
declared that they could not find Luft-Ali, he
ordered 70,000 eyes of the inhabitants to be
brought to him on trays, and is said to have
counted them himself with the point of a dagger.
But this punishment he believed to be still too
lenient. A general massacre of the men was
commanded, and no less than 20,000 women and
children were made into slaves. To this day the
proverbially easy morals of the Kerman women
are attributed to the Afghan invasion, when the
women became the concubines of soldiers and
lost all respect for themselves; and so is the importation
of the dreadful disease which in its
most virulent form is pitifully common in a
great portion of the population of the present
Kerman city. According to some the city was
razed to the ground, but whether this was so or
not, there is no doubt that Kerman has never
recovered from the blow received, and from the
subsequent oppression at the hands of this barbarous
conqueror.</p>

<p>In the south-west part of the mountainous
crescent are three very low passes, by which the
hill range can be crossed. One pass between the
Kala-i-Dukhtar and the Kala-Ardeshir forts; one
between the Kala-Ardeshir and the ruins south
of it along the southern continuation of the
range; and the third at the most southern point
of the crescent, where the precipitous rocky hill-ranges
are separated by a narrow gap, level with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-452" id="Pg_1-452"></a>[<a href="./images/1-452.png">452</a>]</span>
the flat plains on either side. One can still see
the remains of a ruined wall on the east side of
this entrance, a round, outpost mud turret, with
other buildings and a large walled enclosure
directly outside the pass on the flat to the south;
while on the lower slope of the eastern mountain
stands a tall square building, now roofless,
erected on a strong quadrangular base with
corner turrets. It has three pointed arch doorways
(east, west, south), almost as tall as the
building itself, and by the side of these are found
high and broad windows in couples. This
building appears to be of a much more recent
date than the underlying castle filled up with
earth on which it stands. It has rather the
appearance of a fire temple.</p>

<p>On going through the pass we find ourselves
in the centre basin formed by the mountainous
crescent, and here we have another deserted
settlement smaller than Farmidan, also to all
appearance not more than a century old, and
directly under the lee of the precipitous rocky
mountains. A high building of a rich burnt-sienna
colour, with a dome of stone and mortar&mdash;the
latter said to have been mixed with camel's
milk, which gives the mortar greater consistency&mdash;is
to be seen here. This, too, is supposed to
have been a fire temple. Its base is quadrangular,
with two tiers of three windows each. A small
lateral wall is next to the entrance, but nothing
is to be seen in the interior except the bare walls.</p>

<p>East of this, on the face of the cliff and several
hundred feet above the valley, one is shown a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-453" id="Pg_1-453"></a>[<a href="./images/1-453.png">453</a>]</span>
gigantic inscription, "Ya Ali," in white characters
depicted on the rock. The letters are so big
that they can be seen from Kerman, about three
miles off. This is a pilgrimage well worth
making, for they say every wish of those who
climb up to the inscription will come true. Two
qualities are required&mdash;a very steady head and the
agility of a monkey. The angle of the rock is
very steep,&mdash;almost vertical, as can be seen on the
left side of the photograph, which I took from
the site of the inscription looking down upon
the ruined city and the whole Kerman plain.
The only way by which,&mdash;on all fours,&mdash;one can
climb up is so worn, greasy and slippery, owing
to the many pilgrims who have glided up and
down, that it is most difficult to get a grip on the
rock.</p>

<p>Yet the going-up is much easier than the
coming down. The full-page illustration shows
the man who accompanied me just about to
reach the inscription,&mdash;I took the photograph as
I clung to the rock just below him, as can be
seen from the distortion of his lower limbs
caused by my being unable to select a suitable
position from which to take the photograph.
We were then clinging to the rock with a drop
below us in a straight line of several hundred
feet.</p>

<p>We reached the inscription safely enough,
and sat on the edge of the precipice&mdash;the
only place where we could sit&mdash;with our legs
dangling over it. Screened as we were in
deep shadow, we obtained a magnificent bird's-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-454" id="Pg_1-454"></a>[<a href="./images/1-454.png">454</a>]</span>eye
view of the Kerman plain, brilliantly lighted
by the morning sun, and of the forts to our left
(south-west) and the many ruins down below
between ourselves and Kerman city. A bed of
a stream, now dry, wound its way from these
mountains to almost the centre of the plain,
where it lost itself in the sand beyond a cluster of
ruined buildings. Undoubtedly at some previous
time this torrent carried a good volume of water
to the village, and this accounts for the deserted
settlement being found there.</p>

<p>The letters of the inscription were ten feet
high, painted white.</p>

<p class="illc">A Steep Rock Climb, Kerman.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Photograph of Guide taken by the Author on reaching the Inscription several hundred feet above the plain.</p>

<p>The man who had climbed up with me
related an amusing incident of the occasion when
H. E. the Governor of the city was persuaded
to climb to inspect the inscription. Hauled up
with the assistance of ropes and servants, he
became so nervous when he reached the
inscription and looked down upon the precipice
below that he offered a huge reward if they
took him down again alive. Although otherwise
a brave man he was unaccustomed to
mountaineering, and owing to the great height,
had been seized with vertigo and was absolutely
helpless and unable to move. With considerable
difficulty he was hauled down and safely conveyed
to his palace.</p>

<p>The descent presented more difficulty than
the ascent, and one's shoes had to be removed to
effect it in more safety. Eventually we reached
the bottom again where, in a gully is a small
ruined temple and a mud hut or two.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-455" id="Pg_1-455"></a>[<a href="./images/1-455.png">455</a>]</span></p>

<p>A great many women, who from this point
had been watching us come down along the face
of the cliff, stampeded away, giggling, at our
approach, and on my asking why so many
representatives of the fair sex were to be found
here&mdash;there were lots more dotting the landscape
below in their white or black chudders, all converging
towards this point&mdash;it was explained
that, a few yards off, was a rock possessing
marvellous properties. The rock in question
forms part of the mountain-side, and in its
natural formation coarsely suggests, much
magnified, the effigy of a component of feminine
anatomy. At the foot of it there was an
inscription and certain offerings, while above it,
in a recess, a large wax candle was burning.
Near this stone a stunted tree was to be seen,
laden with bits of red and white rags and various
kinds of hair&mdash;a most unedifying sight.</p>

<p>This is a well-known pilgrimage for sterile
women, who, after certain exorcisms in front of
and on the divine stone, and a night or two
spent in the neighbouring ruins, are said infallibly
to become prolific. The neighbouring ruins, it
should be added, are the favourite night resort of
the Kerman young men in search of romantic
adventure, and a most convenient rendezvous for
flirtations; but whether the extraordinary qualities
of prolificness are really due to the occult power
of the magic stone or to the less mystic charms
of nights spent away from home, the reader is no
doubt better able to discriminate than I. Judging
by the long strings of ladies of all ages to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-456" id="Pg_1-456"></a>[<a href="./images/1-456.png">456</a>]</span>
seen going on the pilgrimage, one would almost
come to the conclusion that half the women of
Kerman are in a bad plight, or else that the
other half only is a good lot!</p>

<p>Much unsuspected amusement was provided
to the natives by a Russian political agent who
had visited Kerman a few weeks before I did,
with the intention&mdash;it was stated&mdash;of starting
a Consulate there and a caravanserai to further
Russian trade. Previous to his departure,
attracted merely by the lovely view from the
pilgrimage stone, and absolutely unaware of
what misconstruction might be placed on his
hospitality, the Russian gave a picnic at this spot
to the tiny European community of Kerman.
Needless to say, the evil-minded Persians of
course put a wrong construction upon the whole
thing, and a good deal of merriment was caused
among the natives&mdash;who may lack many other
qualities, but not wit&mdash;by the sahibs going <i>en
masse</i> to the pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The Russian picnic was the talk of the bazaar
when I was there, and will probably remain so
for some little time.</p>

<p>We will now leave ruins and puzzling pilgrimages
alone, and will accept an invitation to a
substantial Persian dinner with Hussein-Ali-Khan,
known by the title of Nusrat-al-Mamalik,
and probably the richest man in the province of
Kerman. At great expense and trouble, this
man bought an English carriage, for the pleasure
of driving in which he actually made a road
several miles long. He kindly sent the carriage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-457" id="Pg_1-457"></a>[<a href="./images/1-457.png">457</a>]</span>
for the Consul and me to drive to his place, and
had relays of horses half-way on the road so that
we could gallop the whole way. He has planted
trees all along the new road, and brought water
down from the hills by a canal along the roadside
in order to provide sufficient moisture to make
them grow.</p>

<p>When we reached Fatabad&mdash;that was the
name of the village close to which our host's
country residence stood&mdash;we alighted at a most
beautiful avenue of high trees on either side of a
long tank of limpid water, in which gracefully
floated dozens of swans and ducks. We were
met at the gate by our host, a charming old
fellow, and his son, Mahommed Ali Khan, a
most intelligent young man. Surrounded by a
crowd of servants we were shown round the
beautiful garden, with its rare plants from all
parts of the world, its well-cared-for flowers,
and its fruit trees of every imaginable kind.
There was a handsome house built in semi-European
style and with European furniture in
it. On a table in the dining-room were spread
a great many trays of sweets. After the usual
compliments dinner was brought in by a long
row of attendants, who carried tray after tray
full of delicacies, part of which they deposited on
the table, the rest on the floor.</p>

<p>Our host, with much modesty, asked us to sit
at the table, and he and his Persian friends sat
themselves on the floor. We&mdash;the Consul, the
two other Englishmen, residents of Kerman, and
myself, however&mdash;declined to take advantage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-458" id="Pg_1-458"></a>[<a href="./images/1-458.png">458</a>]</span>
his offer and declared that we should all sit on
the floor in the best Persian style, an attention
which was greatly appreciated by our host and
by his friends.</p>

<p>It was with some dismay that I saw more
trays of food being conveyed into the room, until
the whole floor was absolutely covered with
trays, large and small, and dishes, cups and
saucers, all brim-full of something or other to
eat.</p>

<p>Persian food of the better kind and in moderation
is not at all bad nor unattractive. It is quite
clean,&mdash;cleaner, if it comes to that, than the
general run of the best European cooking. The
meat is ever fresh and good, the chickens never
too high&mdash;in fact, only killed and bled a few
minutes before they are cooked; the eggs
always newly laid in fact, and not merely in
theory, and the vegetables ever so clean and
tasty. As for the fruit of Central and Southern
Persia, it is eminently excellent and plentiful.</p>

<p>The Persians themselves eat with their fingers,
which they duly wash before beginning their
meals, but we were given silver forks and spoons
and best English knives. Really to enjoy a Persian
meal, however, one's fingers are quite unapproachable
by any more civilised device.</p>

<p>The most sensible part of a Persian meal is its
comparative lack of method and order, anybody
picking wherever he likes from the many dishes
displayed in the centre of the room and all round
him; but any one endowed with digestive organs
of moderate capacity feels some apprehension at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-459" id="Pg_1-459"></a>[<a href="./images/1-459.png">459</a>]</span>
the mountains of rice and food which are placed
before one, and is expected to devour. A European
who wants to be on his best behaviour
finds the last stages of a Persian dinner a positive
trial, and is reminded very forcibly of the terrible
fable of the frog that tried to emulate the cow.
To show the reader to what test of expansion
one's capacity is put, no better evidence can be
given than a faithful enumeration of the viands
spread before us at the dinner here described, all
of which we were made to taste.</p>

<p>To these must be added the numerous sweets
of which one has to partake freely before dinner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-460" id="Pg_1-460"></a>[<a href="./images/1-460.png">460</a>]</span>
Through dinner only water is drunk, or nothing
at all, but before and after, tea&mdash;three-quarters
sugar and one quarter tea, with no milk,&mdash;is
served, and also delicious coffee.</p>

<p>The capacity of Persians is enormous, and on
trying to emulate it we all suffered considerably.
So pressing were our hosts to make us eat some
of this and some of that, and to taste some of the
other, that by the time we had finished we were
all in a semi-conscious state. An attendant
passed round a brass bowl and poured upon our
fingers, from a graceful amphora, tepid water
with rose-leaf scent. Then our host very considerately
had us led to the upper floor of the
building to a deliciously cool room, wherein were
soft silk broad divans with velvet pillows. Five
minutes later, one in each corner of the room,
we were all fast asleep. It is the custom in
Persia to have a siesta after one's meals&mdash;one
needs it badly when one is asked out to dinner.
So for a couple of hours we were left to ourselves,
while our hosts retired to their rooms. Then
more tea was brought, more coffee, more sweets.</p>

<p>We paid an interesting visit to the village of
Fatabad, the older portion of which, formerly
called Rustamabad, had from a distance the appearance
of a strongly fortified place. It had a
high broad wall with four circular towers at the
corners, and quite an imposing gateway. The
interior of the village was curious, the habitations
being adjacent to the village wall all round,
and each room having a perforated dome over it.
There was spacious stabling on one side for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-461" id="Pg_1-461"></a>[<a href="./images/1-461.png">461</a>]</span>
horses, and several irregular courts in the centre of
the village. A long wall stretched from this village
to the Fatabad gardens and palatial dwelling of
Hussein-Ali-Khan, and on one side of this wall
were nicely kept wheat fields, while on the other
lay a capital fruit garden.</p>

<p>In the new village of Fatabad, directly outside
the wall of Rustamabad, there were but few
houses, with an interesting underground hammam,
with water coming from natural mineral springs
brought here from the village of Ikhtiyarabad,
some little distance off. Behind this village, to
the west, a barrier of high rugged hills closed
the horizon before us, and made the view a most
delightfully picturesque one.</p>

<p>In the evening, in the same grand carriage,
we were again conveyed back to Kerman, as I
intended to start at midnight on my journey
across the Great Salt Desert.</p>
